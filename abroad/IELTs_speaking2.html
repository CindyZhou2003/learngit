<p>Describe a village that you visited</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although I was born and raised in Shanghai, a bustling city, I had the chance to visit a village during a trip to Chongming Island. It was a refreshing experience, as it felt completely different from the urban environment I’m used to.</p>
<p>The village was small but incredibly peaceful, surrounded by lush greenery and open fields. There were narrow paths lined with trees, and many houses had traditional designs, with tiled roofs and whitewashed walls. What stood out to me the most was how quiet and calm everything was compared to the city’s constant noise and rush.</p>
<p>During my visit, I spent time exploring the countryside, walking along the canals, and enjoying the fresh air. I even had the opportunity to taste some local food, including freshly harvested vegetables and homemade tofu, which were delicious and felt so natural. The villagers were warm and welcoming, and their simple lifestyle left a deep impression on me.</p>
<p>Although my visit was brief, it gave me a glimpse of how life can be slower yet fulfilling. It also made me appreciate the beauty of nature and the importance of stepping away from the fast pace of city life every now and then.</p>

<h4 id="1colors16">（1）Colors（1.6）<a class="headerlink" href="#1colors16" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>What's your favorite color?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>My favorite color is light green. I find it incredibly refreshing and calming at the same time. It gives me a sense of vitality, as it reminds me of nature, like fresh leaves in spring or a peaceful meadow. At the same time, it has a quiet and soothing quality that helps me feel relaxed, especially when I’m stressed. I think it’s a perfect balance between energy and tranquility, which is why I’m drawn to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>What's the color you dislike? Why?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not really fond of brown. To me, it often looks a bit dirty and too dark, which makes it feel dull and unappealing. While I understand some people find it earthy and natural, it just doesn’t resonate with me. I prefer colors that are more vibrant or calming, so brown isn’t something I’d choose for my clothes or decor.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>What colors do your friends like most?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of my friends don’t have a strong preference for a particular color. They tend to choose colors based on the occasion or what suits them at the moment. For example, some might wear bright colors for a party but go for neutral tones like white or gray in their daily lives. I think they’re quite flexible when it comes to colors.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>What color makes you uncomfortable in your room?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d feel uncomfortable if my room were painted black. It’s just too dark and gloomy for me, and it might even make the space feel smaller than it actually is. I associate black with depression or a lack of energy, so I’d much prefer lighter, more uplifting colors like light green or pastel tones to create a positive atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Have you ever bought something because of its color?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I’ve never bought anything solely because of its color. I’m more practical when it comes to shopping, so I prioritize functionality over appearance. For example, when I buy clothes or gadgets, I focus on whether they meet my needs rather than how they look. That said, if something has a nice color and is functional, it’s definitely a bonus!</p>

<h4 id="2borrowing-lending16">（2）Borrowing/ Lending（1.6）<a class="headerlink" href="#2borrowing-lending16" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>Have you ever borrowed books from others?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I’ve borrowed books from others, especially when I was in school or university. It’s a great way to access resources without having to buy them, and I’ve always made sure to return the books in good condition. Borrowing books also gives me a chance to explore new topics or authors that I might not have considered otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Have you ever borrowed money from others?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>No, I’ve never borrowed money from others. I prefer to manage my finances carefully and avoid situations where I might need to rely on someone else for financial help. If I ever face a financial challenge, I’d try to find a solution on my own first, like cutting expenses or saving more.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you like to lend things to others?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I’m generally willing to lend things to others, especially if it’s something they genuinely need. I believe in helping people out when I can, whether it’s lending a book, a tool, or even offering advice. However, I do expect the person to return the item in good condition and within a reasonable time frame.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>How do you feel when people don't return things they borrowed from you?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>It depends on what they borrowed. If it’s something small, like a pen or a notebook, I’d probably just let it go and not make a big deal. But if it’s something more valuable or important, I’d be quite upset and might even go to their home to demand it back. In such cases, I’d also think twice before lending them anything again in the future.</p>

<li>Is wearing hats popular in your country?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, wearing hats is quite popular in my country. Many people wear different types of hats to match their outfits and enhance their overall style. For example, in the summer, you’ll often see people wearing wide-brimmed 宽帽檐 hats or baseball caps to protect themselves from the sun while still looking fashionable. In winter, beanies and woolen hats are common because they’re both practical and stylish. I think hats are a great way to add a touch of charm and personality to an outfit, so it’s no surprise they’re so popular.</p>

<li>Where do you like to buy hats?</li>
</ol>

<p>online, convenient </p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>What kind of hats do you have?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically 2 kinds of hats. In the summer, I like to wear baseball caps because they’re great for keeping the sun off my face and providing some shade. On the other hand, during the winter, I switch to knitted hats, as they help keep me warm and protect my ears from the cold. I find both styles not only practical but also easy to match with my outfits.</p>

<ol>
<li>What stories did you like when you were young?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was young, I was really into fantasy and fairy tales. I loved how these stories were full of imagination, magic, and often had themes of love and adventure. They transported me to different worlds where anything was possible, and I found that incredibly exciting. Stories like <em>Cinderella</em> or <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> were my favorites because they allowed me to dream big and escape reality for a while.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you prefer listening to stories or reading them?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I definitely prefer reading stories over listening to them. When I read, I can take my time to understand the plot and characters at my own pace, and I enjoy the tactile experience of holding a book or flipping through pages. It feels more personal and immersive. On the other hand, while listening to stories is easier and more convenient, especially when multitasking, I find it harder to fully engage with the story compared to reading.</p>

<ol>
<li>Did you enjoy traveling by car when you were a kid?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I absolutely loved traveling by car when I was a kid. It was always exciting because it usually meant we were going somewhere fun, like an amusement park or a scenic spot. I remember feeling a sense of adventure and anticipation during those trips, and I’d often look out the window, enjoying the view and imagining what the destination would be like.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>What types of cars do you like?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m particularly fond of big SUV cars, like Jeeps. They’re not only comfortable but also very spacious, which makes long journeys much more enjoyable. I also like how they’re designed for both city driving and off-road adventures, giving a sense of versatility and freedom. Plus, they feel safer and more robust compared to smaller cars.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you prefer to be a driver or a passenger?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I prefer being a passenger rather than a driver. Driving can be quite tiring, especially on long trips, and it requires a lot of focus. As a passenger, I can relax, enjoy the scenery, and even take a nap if I want to. It’s a much more stress-free experience, and I can fully appreciate the journey without worrying about the road.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>What do you usually do when there is a traffic jam?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When there’s a traffic jam, I usually try to make the most of the time by taking a nap or watching TV dramas on my phone. It’s a good way to kill time and stay entertained, especially if the jam lasts for a while. Sometimes, I also listen to music or podcasts to keep myself relaxed and distracted from the frustration of being stuck in traffic.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Do you think car colors are important?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I think car colors are quite important. For certain vehicles, like police cars or ambulances, the color combination serves a functional purpose, making them easily recognizable in emergencies. For private cars, the color often reflects the owner’s personality or style. For example, someone who chooses a bright red car might be seen as bold and energetic, while a black or white car might suggest a more classic or sophisticated taste.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you like looking at yourself in the mirror? How often?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I do like looking at myself in the mirror, and I do it several times a day. Mostly, it’s to check my attire and make sure I look presentable before leaving the house or attending an event. It’s become a habit for me to quickly glance in the mirror to ensure everything is in place, like my hair or outfit.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Have you ever bought mirrors?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I’ve bought a small mirror before. I have one in my dormitory that I use for daily grooming, like styling my hair or applying skincare products. It’s compact and convenient, so it doesn’t take up much space, which is perfect for a small living area like a dorm room.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you usually take a mirror with you?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>No, not really. I don’t feel the need to carry a mirror with me all the time. I think it’s unnecessary because I don’t have to check my appearance constantly. If I really need to, I can use my phone’s camera or find a mirror in public places like restrooms.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Would you use mirrors to decorate your room?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>No, I wouldn’t use mirrors to decorate my room, especially not in front of the bed. In Chinese culture, it’s considered unlucky to place a mirror directly opposite the bed, as it’s believed to bring negative energy or disturb sleep. So, I’d avoid using mirrors for decorative purposes in my room, even though they can make spaces look bigger and brighter.</p>

In my daily life, I prefer using WeChat to stay in touch with friends, family, or teachers because it’s more convenient and instant. Emails feel a bit more formal and time-consuming, so I only resort to them when necessary.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there an advertisement that made an impression on you when you were a child?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there’s one advertisement that left a lasting impression on me when I was a child. It was for a brand of mineral water, and what made it memorable was its unique storytelling approach. The ad featured a man and a woman trapped in a rock cave, and while the story was dramatic and engaging, it didn’t seem to have much to do with the water itself. I remember being fascinated by the creativity, even though I didn’t fully understand the connection at the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you see a lot of advertising on trains or other transport?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I see a lot of advertising on public transport, especially on subways. There are posters and digital screens everywhere. It’s hard to miss them because they’re strategically placed in high-traffic areas, like inside the train cars or on the platform walls. While some ads are creative, others can feel a bit overwhelming due to their sheer volume.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you like advertisements?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>No, not really. I find that advertisements often consume a lot of my time without adding much value to my life. For example, when I’m watching a video or browsing online, ads can interrupt the experience, and most of them don’t seem relevant to me. While I understand their purpose, I generally find them more annoying than helpful.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>What kind of advertising do you like?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I prefer storytelling ads that don’t directly promote a specific product. These ads often use creative narratives or emotional themes to engage the audience, making them more memorable and enjoyable to watch. For example, I’ve seen ads that tell a heartwarming story or showcase a unique concept, and only at the end do they subtly introduce the product. I find this approach much more appealing than traditional ads that simply push a product in your face.</p>

<li>In what conditions would you use a computer?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I use a computer mainly for studying and programming since I’m majoring in software engineering. It’s an essential tool for completing assignments and writing code. I also use it for research, online classes, and sometimes for entertainment, like watching videos or playing games. Without a computer, it would be almost impossible to keep up with my coursework.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>When was the first time you used a computer?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The first time I used a computer was in grade 3, during an IT class at school. I remember being fascinated by how it worked and feeling excited to learn something so modern and advanced at the time. That class introduced me to basic functions like typing and using simple software, which sparked my interest in technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>What would your life be like without computers?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I honestly can’t imagine my life without computers. They’ve become such an integral part of daily life, not just for me but for everyone. For example, I rely on them for studying, communication, and even entertainment. Without computers, tasks would take much longer, and many modern conveniences we take for granted would simply disappear. It would feel like going back in time.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>In what conditions would it be difficult for you to use a computer?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be difficult to use a computer while traveling, especially if there’s no proper desk or stable surface to place it on. For instance, on a crowded train or bus, it’s hard to balance a laptop and focus on the screen. Additionally, if there’s no reliable internet connection or power source, using a computer becomes inconvenient or even impossible.</p>

<li>Have you ever seen old buildings in the city?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I’ve seen quite a few old buildings in the city center. In my city, there are still some traditional residential areas called <em>Nongtang</em> in Chinese. These buildings have a unique architectural style and reflect the city’s history and culture. Walking through these areas feels like stepping back in time, and it’s fascinating to see how people lived in the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you think we should preserve old buildings in cities?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I strongly believe we should preserve some old buildings because of their historical and cultural value. They serve as a reminder of the city’s heritage and help us understand how life used to be. Additionally, they often attract tourists, which can benefit the local economy. However, it’s also important to balance preservation with modern development to meet the needs of a growing population.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you prefer living in an old building or a modern house?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I definitely prefer living in a modern house. Modern buildings are designed with convenience and comfort in mind, featuring amenities like elevators, better insulation, and advanced facilities. Old buildings, while charming, often lack these modern comforts and can be less practical for daily living. For me, functionality and comfort are more important than historical appeal when it comes to choosing a place to live.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you often feel bored?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>No, I don’t often feel bored because I always keep myself busy and try to find something new to do. Whether it’s studying, working on a project, or exploring a new hobby, I make sure my time is filled with meaningful activities. I think staying productive and curious helps me avoid boredom.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>When would you feel bored?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I usually feel bored when I don’t have a clear plan or goal and don’t know what to pursue. For example, if I have a free day with no schedule or tasks, I might feel a bit lost and end up doing nothing productive. In those moments, boredom creeps in because I lack direction or motivation.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>What do you do when you feel bored?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When I feel bored, I usually browse social media platforms like Red Note or Weibo to pass the time. Sometimes, I also try to pick up a new hobby, like cooking or painting, to keep myself engaged. These activities help me break the monotony and add a bit of excitement to my day.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you think childhood is boring or adulthood is boring?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I think adulthood is more boring compared to childhood. As a child, life was carefree and full of curiosity, with no major responsibilities. However, adulthood is often dominated by work, family obligations, and routine, which can feel monotonous over time. While adulthood has its rewards, it lacks the spontaneity and freedom that made childhood so exciting.</p>

<li>What will you do if you find something lost by others?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If I find something lost by others, I would take it to the lost and found office. I think it’s the most practical and responsible way to handle the situation, as it increases the chances of the item being returned to its owner. If there’s no lost and found office nearby, I might <strong>hand it over</strong> to the manager or staff of the place where I found it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you report to the police when finding something lost by others? Why?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I usually don’t report to the police immediately when I find something lost. Instead, I’d first take it to the lost and found office or inform the manager of the place where I found it. Reporting to the police would be <strong>my last resort</strong>, especially if the lost item is very expensive or valuable, like a wallet or a phone. I think this approach is more efficient and avoids unnecessary complications.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Have you ever lost things?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I’ve lost things quite a few times. When I was in primary school, I often lost small items like erasers or rulers because I wasn’t very organized back then. In college, I once lost my keys, which was quite stressful because I needed them to access my dorm room. Luckily, I found them after retracing my steps, but it taught me to be more careful with my belongings.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Will you post on social media if you lose your item?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I would post about it on social media, especially on platforms like my school forum or community groups. I think it’s a quick and effective way to reach a large number of people who might have seen or found the lost item. It’s also a way to appeal to the kindness of others, as someone might come across the post and help me recover what I’ve lost.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Do you think your talent can be useful for your future work? Why?</li>

<p>Yes, I believe my creativity and DIY skills can be useful for my future work. In many fields, especially those related to design, engineering, or even problem-solving, creativity is highly valued. Being able to <strong>think outside the box</strong> and create practical solutions could <strong>give me an edge</strong> in my career.</p>

<p>In the evening, I usually do my homework or review my classes. It’s a time when I can reflect on what I’ve learned during the day and make sure I’m prepared for the next. Sometimes, I also relax by watching a show or reading a book to unwind after a busy day.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>What did you do in the evening when you were little? Why?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was little, I used to cycle around the neighborhood or watch TV at home in the evening. <strong>Back then</strong>那时, I didn’t have much homework, and classes ended early, around 3 pm, so I had plenty of free time to relax and enjoy myself. It was a carefree and fun part of my childhood.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Are there any differences between what you do in the evening now and what you did in the past?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there’s a big difference. When I was younger, evenings were all about playing and relaxing, like cycling or watching TV. Now, evenings are more about being productive—completing homework, reviewing lessons, or preparing for the next day. I have less free time, but I still try to balance work with some relaxation.</p>

</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you often go out with your friends?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I go out with my friends several times a year, especially during holidays or special occasions. It’s a great way to <strong>catch up</strong>, relax, and create lasting memories together. While we might not meet as often as we’d like due to busy schedules, we always make the most of our time together.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">

</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Do you prefer to spend time with one friend or with a group of friends?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I prefer spending time with a group of friends because it’s more dynamic and fun. Being in a group allows for more diverse conversations and activities, and it’s always interesting to see how everyone interacts. However, one-on-one time with a close friend can also be special for deeper conversations.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>Would you invite friends to your home?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I would definitely invite friends to my home. I’m always glad when they visit, as it’s a more personal and comfortable setting to spend time together. Whether it’s for a meal, a movie night, or just hanging out, having friends over creates a warm and welcoming atmosphere.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you often read books? When?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I often read books in my spare time, usually in the evening or at night. It’s a relaxing way to unwind after a busy day, and I enjoy immersing myself in a good story or learning something new from non-fiction books.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Are your reading habits now different than before?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, my reading habits have changed over time. Now, I mostly read electronic books rather than physical ones. E-books are more convenient because I can carry multiple books on my device and read them anytime, anywhere. However, I still appreciate the feel of a physical book occasionally. </p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Have you ever read a novel that has been adapted into a film?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I’ve read <em>The Wandering Earth</em>, which was adapted into a film. Interestingly, I watched the movie first and then read the book. While the movie was visually stunning, the book provided more depth and detail, which made the story even more engaging.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which do you prefer, reading books or watching movies?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I prefer reading books because they allow me to use my imagination and engage more deeply with the story. Books often provide more details and insights into the characters and plot, which I find more satisfying than the condensed version typically presented in movies.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Do you read more or less now than when you were younger?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I read less now than when I was younger. Back then, I had more free time and fewer responsibilities, so I could spend hours reading. Now, with schoolwork and other daily commitments, it’s harder to find time to read as much as I’d like. However, I still try to make reading a regular part of my routine.</p>

<p>My favorite place to sit is definitely the sofa. It’s soft, comfortable, and perfect for relaxing after a long day. Whether I’m watching TV, reading a book, or just chatting with friends, the sofa is my go-to spot for comfort.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you always sit down for a long time?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>No, I try not to sit for long periods because I know it’s unhealthy. Prolonged sitting can lead to back pain and other health issues, so I make an effort to stand up, stretch, or take short walks throughout the day. It’s important to stay active, even if I’m working or studying.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you feel sleepy when you are sitting down?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, I do feel sleepy when sitting down, especially if I haven’t had enough sleep the night before. The comfort of the sofa or a cozy chair can make it tempting to doze off, but I try to stay awake and focused if I have tasks to complete.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>When you were a kid, did you usually sit on the floor?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In my memory, I didn’t usually sit on the floor as a kid. I preferred sitting on chairs or sofas, as they were more comfortable. However, I do remember sitting on the floor occasionally while playing with toys or games, but it wasn’t a regular habit.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Do you find it easy to fall asleep when sitting on a sofa?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I rarely sleep on the sofa because I prefer sleeping in bed. While the sofa is comfortable, it’s not ideal for a proper nap or a good night’s sleep. If I’m really tired, I might doze off on the sofa for a short while, but I always try to move to my bed for a more restful sleep.</p>

<p>Not really. I prefer appreciating the views or shows directly with my eyes rather than through a camera.

<p>Why you think this person is energetic</p>
<p>And explain how you feel about this person</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An energetic person I know is my cousin, who is five years younger than me. He’s a lively and enthusiastic boy who always seems to have endless energy. One of his favorite activities is playing basketball. He spends hours on the court, whether it’s practicing his shots, playing with his friends, or just enjoying the game.</p>
<p>Apart from basketball, he loves going out with his friends to explore new places or try different activities. He’s the kind of person who’s always on the move, whether it’s walking his dog in the park or organizing group outings. What’s really impressive is how he manages to keep up his energy even after a busy day.</p>
<p>I think what makes him so energetic is his positive attitude. He’s always cheerful and looks for the fun side of things, which inspires others around him. Spending time with him is never boring because his energy is so contagious.</p>
<p>Overall, my cousin’s lively personality and active lifestyle make him stand out. He motivates me to stay active and enjoy life more, which is why I admire his energetic spirit so much.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>1. What kinds of jobs need a lot of physical work?</strong>
Jobs that require a lot of physical work typically include construction work, farming, manufacturing, and roles in the service industry like cleaning or delivery services. These jobs often involve heavy lifting, long hours of standing, or repetitive tasks that demand physical strength and endurance. For example, construction workers need to carry heavy materials and operate machinery, while farmers spend hours in the fields under challenging weather conditions. These roles are essential for society but can be quite demanding on the body.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. What's the difference between the payment for physical work and that for mental work?</strong>
Generally, jobs that require mental work, such as those in technology, finance, or management, tend to offer higher salaries compared to physical labor jobs. This is because mental work often involves specialized skills, education, and decision-making responsibilities, which are highly valued in the job market. On the other hand, physical work, while equally important, is sometimes seen as less specialized and more replaceable, which can lead to lower wages. However, there are exceptions, such as skilled tradespeople or athletes, who can earn significant incomes due to their expertise or physical abilities.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. Can physical workers receive higher salaries in the future?</strong>
It’s possible, but it depends on several factors. For instance, if there’s a shortage of physical workers in certain industries, their salaries might increase due to higher demand. Additionally, as automation becomes more common, skilled physical workers who can operate or maintain advanced machinery might see their wages rise. However, in many cases, physical work may still be undervalued compared to mental work unless there’s a significant shift in how society perceives and rewards these roles.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>4. Do you think machines could replace human workers in the future?</strong>
Yes, to some extent, machines are already replacing human workers, especially in repetitive or dangerous tasks. For example, in manufacturing, robots are now commonly used for assembly lines, and in agriculture, machines can harvest crops more efficiently. However, I don’t think machines will completely replace humans because many jobs require creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex decision-making, which machines cannot replicate. Instead, I believe the future will involve humans working alongside machines to improve productivity and safety.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>5. Do you think you are an energetic person?</strong>
Yes, I consider myself an energetic person. I’m always eager to <mark>take on new challenges</mark> and stay active, whether it’s at work, during exercise, or in my personal life. I find that being energetic helps me stay motivated and productive, and I enjoy pushing myself to achieve my goals. However, I also make sure to balance my energy with proper rest and relaxation to avoid burnout.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>6. Do you think there was more physical labor in the past than there is now?</strong>
Absolutely. In the past, physical labor was much more common because many tasks had to be done manually due to the lack of technology. For example, farming, construction, and manufacturing relied heavily on human effort. However, with the advancement of technology and automation, many of these tasks are now performed by machines, reducing the need for physical labor. While physical work still exists, it’s less prevalent than it used to be, and more people are now engaged in mental or service-oriented jobs.</p>
<h4 id="2">（2）近期日常改变<a class="headerlink" href="#2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Describe a positive change that you have made recently in your daily routine</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What the change is</p>
<p>How you have changed the routine</p>
<p>Why you think it is a positive change</p>
<p>And explain how you feel about the change</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A positive change I recently made to my daily routine is adjusting my sleep schedule. I used to stay up late almost every night, spending hours browsing apps like Red Book to entertain myself. While it was fun at the time, I realized it left me feeling tired and unproductive the next day.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve set my mind to getting up early and sleeping early. At first, it was challenging to break the habit, but I started by setting a strict bedtime and avoiding using my phone before bed. Instead, I read a book or listen to relaxing music to <mark>wind down</mark>.</p>
<p>This change has made a big difference in my life. Waking up early gives me extra time in the morning to prepare for the day, whether it’s exercising, eating a proper breakfast, or planning my tasks. I also feel more energized and focused throughout the day, which has improved my productivity and overall mood.</p>
<p>Looking back, I’m glad I made this change. It’s a small adjustment, but it has had a positive impact on both my physical and mental health. I now feel more in control of my time and enjoy my days much  </p>
<p>more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1. What do people normally plan in their daily lives?</strong>
People usually plan a variety of activities in their daily lives, such as work or study schedules, household chores, exercise routines, and social engagements. For example, many people plan their work tasks to meet deadlines, schedule time for grocery shopping or cooking, and allocate time for hobbies or relaxation. Additionally, some people plan their commutes or childcare arrangements to ensure everything runs smoothly. Planning helps individuals stay organized and manage their time effectively, especially when balancing multiple responsibilities.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. Is time management very important in our daily lives?</strong>
Yes, time management is crucial in our daily lives because it helps us prioritize tasks, avoid procrastination, and achieve our goals efficiently. Without proper time management, people might feel overwhelmed, miss deadlines, or struggle to balance work and personal life. For instance, students need to manage their time to complete assignments and prepare for exams, while working professionals must juggle meetings, projects, and personal commitments. Good time management can reduce stress and improve productivity, making it an essential skill for everyone.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. What changes would people often make?</strong>
People often make changes to their routines, habits, or lifestyles to improve their well-being or achieve specific goals. For example, someone might change their diet to eat healthier, adjust their sleep schedule to get more rest, or start exercising regularly to stay fit. Others might change their work habits, such as organizing their tasks better or setting clearer priorities. Additionally, people might make changes to their social lives, like spending more time with family or pursuing new hobbies. These changes are usually aimed at enhancing quality of life or addressing challenges.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>4. Do you think it is good to change jobs frequently?</strong>
No, I don’t think it’s good to change jobs frequently because it takes a lot of time and effort to adapt to a new workplace, learn new skills, and build relationships with colleagues. Frequent job changes can also make it difficult to establish a stable career path or gain deep expertise in a particular field. Employers might also view this as a lack of commitment. However, there are exceptions—if someone is unhappy in their current role or finds a better opportunity, changing jobs can be beneficial. But overall, stability is usually more advantageous in the long term.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>5. Who do you think would make changes more often, young people or old people?</strong>
I think young people are more likely to make changes frequently because they are still exploring their options and figuring out what they want in life. For example, young people might change jobs, move to new cities, or try different hobbies as they seek new experiences and opportunities. On the other hand, older people tend to be more settled in their routines and preferences, so they might make fewer changes unless necessary. However, this isn’t always the case, as some older individuals might also embrace change to adapt to new circumstances or pursue personal growth.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>6. Who should get more promotion opportunities in the workplace, young people or older people?</strong>
I believe both young and older people should have equal opportunities for promotion, as it should depend on their skills, performance, and contributions rather than their age. Younger employees might bring fresh ideas, energy, and technological expertise, while older employees often have valuable experience, wisdom, and leadership qualities. A fair workplace should recognize and reward talent and hard work regardless of age. This approach not only fosters a positive work environment but also ensures that the organization benefits from the strengths of all its employees.</p>

<p><strong>1. Why do some children not like learning science at school?</strong>
Some children might not enjoy learning science because they find it too abstract or difficult to understand. Science often involves complex concepts, formulas, and theories that can be challenging to grasp, especially if the teaching methods are not engaging. Additionally, if students don’t see the practical applications of science in their daily lives, they might lose interest. For example, learning about chemical reactions or physics principles might seem irrelevant to them if they can’t connect it to real-world scenarios. A lack of hands-on experiments or interactive activities in the classroom can also make science seem boring or intimidating.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. Is it important to study science at school?</strong>
Yes, studying science at school is extremely important because it helps students develop critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a better understanding of the world around them. Science teaches us how things work, from the human body to the environment, and it encourages curiosity and innovation. For instance, learning about biology can help students understand health and nutrition, while studying physics can explain everyday phenomena like electricity or motion. Moreover, science education is essential for preparing students for careers in fields like medicine, engineering, and technology, which are crucial for societal progress.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. Which science subject is the most important for children to learn?</strong>
It’s hard to say which science subject is the most important because each one—biology, chemistry, and physics—plays a vital role in understanding different aspects of life. However, I would argue that biology might be the most relevant for children because it directly relates to their health, the environment, and living organisms. For example, learning about the human body, ecosystems, or genetics can help children make informed decisions about their well-being and the world they live in. That said, chemistry and physics are equally important for understanding materials, energy, and technology, so a balanced approach is ideal.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>4. Should people continue to study science after graduating from school?</strong>
Yes, I believe people should continue to study science even after graduating because scientific knowledge is constantly evolving, and staying informed helps individuals make better decisions in their personal and professional lives. For example, understanding new medical research can improve health choices, while learning about climate science can encourage environmentally friendly behaviors. Additionally, science literacy is essential for critically evaluating information in the media, such as news about vaccines or renewable energy. Lifelong learning in science can also inspire curiosity and innovation, which are valuable in any field.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>5. How do you get to know about scientific news?</strong>
I usually get scientific news from reliable online sources, such as science-focused websites, news platforms, or social media accounts of reputable organizations. For example, I follow platforms like BBC Science, National Geographic, or scientific journals that summarize research in an accessible way. I also watch documentaries or YouTube channels that explain complex topics in a simple and engaging manner. Occasionally, I attend public lectures or webinars hosted by universities or research institutions to stay updated on the latest discoveries and advancements.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>6. Should scientists explain the research process to the public?</strong>
Yes, I think scientists should explain their research process to the public because it helps build trust and understanding. Many scientific concepts can be complex, and without clear explanations, people might misunderstand or distrust scientific findings. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, clear communication about vaccine development was crucial to address public concerns and encourage vaccination. By explaining the research process in simple terms, scientists can make their work more accessible and demonstrate its relevance to everyday life. This also encourages public support for scientific endeavors and fosters a culture of curiosity and learning.</p>

<p><strong>1. What do you think of national identity?</strong>
National identity is an important concept because it reflects a sense of belonging and shared culture among people from the same country. It includes elements like language, traditions, history, and values that unite individuals and give them a sense of pride. For example, celebrating national holidays or participating in cultural events can strengthen this identity. However, I think it’s also important to balance national identity with global awareness, as being too focused on one’s own culture can sometimes lead to a lack of understanding or appreciation for other cultures.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. What are the advantages of working in an international company?</strong>
Working in an international company offers several advantages. First, it provides exposure to diverse cultures and perspectives, which can enhance creativity and problem-solving skills. For example, collaborating with colleagues from different backgrounds can lead to innovative ideas and approaches. Second, it often offers opportunities for professional growth, such as training programs, international assignments, or networking with global experts. Finally, working in such an environment can improve communication and adaptability, as employees learn to navigate cultural differences and work effectively in multicultural teams.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. How does travelling abroad affect young people?</strong>
Travelling abroad can have a profound impact on young people. It broadens their horizons by exposing them to new cultures, languages, and ways of thinking, which can foster open-mindedness and tolerance. For example, experiencing different lifestyles or traditions can challenge their assumptions and help them appreciate diversity. Additionally, travelling can build independence and confidence, as young people learn to navigate unfamiliar environments and solve problems on their own. It also provides valuable life experiences that can shape their personal and professional development.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>4. How do people get information about other countries?</strong>
People can get information about other countries through various sources, such as the internet, books, documentaries, and social media. For instance, travel blogs, news websites, and platforms like YouTube offer insights into different cultures, traditions, and current events. Additionally, talking to people who have visited or lived in other countries can provide firsthand perspectives. Educational programs, such as history or geography classes, also play a role in teaching people about the world. Overall, the availability of diverse resources makes it easier than ever to learn about other countries.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>5. Do you think reading is a good way to get to know other countries? Why?</strong>
Yes, I think reading is an excellent way to learn about other countries because it provides in-depth and reliable information. Books, whether they are travel guides, historical accounts, or novels, offer detailed insights into a country’s culture, history, and society. For example, reading a novel set in a specific country can give readers a sense of its traditions, values, and daily life. Additionally, reading allows people to explore topics at their own pace and reflect on what they’ve learned, making it a more immersive and thoughtful way to understand other cultures.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>6. What do you think makes countries different?</strong>
Countries differ in many ways, including their cultures, traditions, languages, and histories. For example, customs like food, festivals, and social norms vary widely from one country to another. Additionally, geographical factors, such as climate and natural resources, influence how people live and interact with their environment. Political systems and economic conditions also play a role in shaping a country’s identity and development. These differences make each country unique and contribute to the rich diversity of the world, which is something to be celebrated and respected.</p>

<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What the decision was</p>
<p>How you made your decision</p>
<p>What the results of the decision were</p>
<p>And explain why it was important</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year, I made a very hard decision of breaking up with（提分手） my boyfriend. Now he’s my ex-boyfriend. Coming to think of it, it turned out to be an important decision in my life and it was definitely the right thing to do/ it was a good call（是正确的选择）.
We had been together for about three years, and during that period of time, I was in two minds（犹豫，纠结） all the time. <em>On one hand</em>, he was funny and charming. He could really make me laugh. I loved his sense of humor （我喜欢他的幽默感） and his charisma. <em>On the other hand</em>, he was a control freak. He always wanted me to listen to him, and say yes to him. He really put a lot of pressure on me. I mean, I’m an independent person with an independent mind, so I couldn’t just blindly follow his commands（跟随他的指令）. He was very bossy（霸道的） and macho（大男子主义的）.
I <strong>was torn between</strong>（很纠结） leaving and staying. I didn’t want to rush into the decision（匆忙做决定）, so I waited long enough because I wanted to give it a chance. After being together for three years, I was very unhappy, so I finally made up my mind（彻底下决定） to leave him. I told him about my decision. It wasn’t easy for me. I was crying and having a meltdown when I saw him for the last time. And he refused to take it. We were not <strong>on the same page</strong> at all（意见不一致，他不想分手）.
After the breakup, in the beginning, he was still trying to influence my decision by constantly calling me and trying to see me. It was extremely difficult for me to not pick up the phone. But I pulled myself together（振作起来）. I didn’t give him any chances to talk to me. And eventually, after 6 months, he gave up.
I’m now feeling so much better without him. Everything is water under the bridge（事情都过去了）. Even though I still miss him sometimes, I know it will all be over one day. Time will heal everything（时间会治愈一切）. It was a tough decision to make, but it was the right thing to do.</p>

<p><strong>1. Do you think children sometimes have to make important decisions?</strong>
Yes, I believe children sometimes have to make important decisions, although these decisions might not seem as significant from an adult’s perspective. For example, children might need to decide which extracurricular activities to join, how to manage their time between schoolwork and hobbies, or how to handle conflicts with friends. These decisions can shape their personal development and teach them valuable life skills like responsibility and problem-solving. While adults often guide them, children still play a key role in making choices that affect their daily lives.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. What important decisions do teenagers need to make after graduation?</strong>
After graduation, teenagers face several important decisions that can significantly impact their future. One of the most critical decisions is choosing a career path or field of study, which often involves selecting a university or vocational training program. They also need to decide whether to enter the workforce immediately or pursue further education. Additionally, teenagers might have to make decisions about their personal lives, such as managing finances, living independently, or balancing work and social commitments. These choices require careful thought and planning, as they lay the foundation for their adult lives.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. Who can children turn to for help when making a decision?</strong>
Children can turn to various people for help when making decisions, depending on the situation. Most commonly, they seek guidance from their parents or guardians, who have more experience and can offer advice based on their own lives. Teachers and school counselors are also valuable resources, especially for decisions related to education or career paths. Additionally, children might consult friends or siblings for support, particularly when dealing with social or personal issues. Having a network of trusted individuals helps children feel more confident and informed when making decisions.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>4. Do you think advertisements can influence our decisions when shopping?</strong>
Yes, advertisements can significantly influence our shopping decisions because they are designed to attract attention and create a desire for products. For example, advertisements often use persuasive techniques like emotional appeals, celebrity endorsements, or limited-time offers to convince consumers to buy something. They can also shape our perceptions of a product’s quality or value, even if we weren’t initially interested in it. While some people are more resistant to advertising, it’s hard to deny that it plays a powerful role in shaping consumer behavior.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>5. Do you think the influence of advertising is good?</strong>
The influence of advertising can be both positive and negative. On the positive side, advertisements can inform consumers about new products, services, or innovations that might improve their lives. For example, ads for eco-friendly products can raise awareness about sustainability. However, advertising can also have negative effects, such as promoting unrealistic beauty standards or encouraging excessive consumption. Additionally, some ads might be misleading or manipulative, leading people to make poor purchasing decisions. Overall, the impact of advertising depends on how it’s used and the intentions behind it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>6. How do people usually make important decisions?</strong>
People usually make important decisions by gathering information, weighing the pros and cons, and considering their goals and values. For example, someone deciding on a career might research different fields, seek advice from mentors, and reflect on their interests and skills. Emotions and intuition also play a role, as people often rely on their gut feelings when faced with tough choices. Additionally, discussing the decision with trusted friends or family members can provide new perspectives and help clarify thoughts. Ultimately, the process varies depending on the individual and the complexity of the decision.</p>
<h4 id="6115">（6）学校/工作中的重要规则（1.15）<a class="headerlink" href="#6115" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Describe a rule that is important in your school or at work</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What the rule is about</p>
<p>What happens when people break the rule</p>
<p>Why you think it is an important rule</p>
<p>And explain how you feel about the rule</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One important rule in my school was that students were not allowed to use mobile phones during class. This rule was meant to ensure that everyone stayed focused on their studies instead of getting distracted by social media, games, or chatting with friends.</p>
<p>If someone broke this rule, the teacher would usually confiscate their phone for the rest of the day. In more serious cases, the school might inform the student’s parents or even impose a temporary ban on bringing phones to school. This was quite an effective way to enforce discipline, as no one wanted to lose access to their phones, even for a few hours.</p>
<p>I believe this rule was essential because it helped maintain a good learning environment. Nowadays, mobile phones can be very distracting, and once a student starts scrolling through social media or texting, it’s hard to pay attention to the lesson. Also, banning phones in class encouraged students to interact with each other face-to-face rather than relying on digital communication all the time.</p>
<p>Personally, I had mixed feelings about this rule. On one hand, I understood its purpose and agreed that it helped us concentrate better. On the other hand, there were times when I needed my phone to check something important, like a dictionary or study materials. However, overall, I think it was a reasonable rule that benefited most students in the long run.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>1. What rules should children follow at home in your country?</strong>
In my country, children are typically expected to follow several rules at home to ensure discipline and harmony. For example, they are often required to complete their homework before playing or using electronic devices. They are also expected to help with household chores, such as cleaning their rooms or setting the table for meals. Additionally, respecting elders, speaking politely, and adhering to bedtime schedules are common rules. These rules help children develop responsibility, time management skills, and good manners, which are essential for their personal growth.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. On what occasions can children be forgiven if they don't follow some rules?</strong>
Children can usually be forgiven for breaking rules if it’s their first time or if they didn’t fully understand the rule. For example, if a child accidentally spills something while trying to help with chores, parents might be more lenient. Similarly, during special occasions like birthdays or festivals, rules might be relaxed to allow children to enjoy themselves. Additionally, if a child is unwell or going through a difficult time, parents might show more understanding and flexibility. Forgiveness in such situations helps maintain a positive and supportive family environment.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. What rules should people follow when using public transport?</strong>
When using public transport, people should follow several rules to ensure safety and comfort for everyone. For instance, they should queue politely when boarding and give priority to elderly, pregnant, or disabled passengers. It’s also important to keep noise levels low, avoid eating or drinking, and keep the area clean. Additionally, passengers should follow safety guidelines, such as holding onto handrails and staying behind marked lines on platforms. These rules help create a pleasant and efficient public transport experience for all users.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>4. What kinds of rules do people need to follow in public places?</strong>
In public places, people need to follow rules that promote safety, cleanliness, and respect for others.

In places like parks or museums, people are expected to stay on marked paths, avoid damaging property, and follow instructions from staff. Additionally, social etiquette, such as being polite and considerate of others, is important in maintaining a harmonious environment. These rules ensure that public spaces remain enjoyable and accessible for everyone.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>5. What are the reasons that cause people to break rules?</strong>
People might break rules for various reasons, such as lack of awareness, convenience, or rebellion. For instance, someone might not know about a specific rule or misunderstand its importance. Others might break rules to save time or effort, like jaywalking to avoid a long detour. In some cases, people might intentionally break rules as a form of protest or to challenge authority. Stress or emotional distress can also lead to rule-breaking, as individuals might act impulsively without considering the consequences. Understanding these reasons can help address the root causes of rule violations.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>6. When people break rules, how would they be punished in your country?</strong>
In my country, the punishment for breaking rules depends on the severity of the violation. For minor offenses, such as littering or noise complaints, people might receive a warning or a fine. More serious violations, like breaking traffic laws or damaging public property, can result in heavier fines, community service, or even legal action. In schools or workplaces, rule-breakers might face disciplinary measures like suspension or loss of privileges. The goal of these punishments is to discourage rule-breaking and encourage individuals to act responsibly.</p>

<p>Describe your grandparents' job</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>what it was</p>
<p>how long he or she had this job</p>
<p>how he or she got the job</p>
<p>what skills this job needs</p>
<p>and whether you would like to have this job in the future</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to talk about my grandmother, who was a farmer for most of her life. She worked in agriculture, growing crops like rice, wheat, and vegetables on a small family farm in the countryside. She had this job for over 40 years, starting when she was very young and continuing until she retired in her late 60s.</p>
<p>My grandmother got into farming because it was a family tradition. Her parents were also farmers, so she learned the skills and knowledge from them from a very early age. She didn’t have a formal education in agriculture, but she had a lot of practical experience and understood the land, the seasons, and how to grow different crops.</p>
<p>Being a farmer requires a wide range of skills. For example, you need to be physically strong because farming involves a lot of manual labor, like planting, harvesting, and carrying heavy loads. You also need to be patient and resilient because farming depends heavily on the weather, and sometimes crops can fail due to droughts or floods. Additionally, my grandmother had to be very resourceful and creative in solving problems, like finding ways to protect crops from pests or managing limited resources.</p>
<p>As for whether I’d like to have this job in the future, I don’t think so. While I deeply respect my grandmother’s hard work and dedication, farming is a very demanding job, both physically and mentally. I also think it’s quite unpredictable because of factors like climate change, which makes it even more challenging. However, I do admire the connection to nature and the sense of independence that comes with farming. It’s just not the right career path for me personally.</p>

<p>Describe a time you made a promise to someone</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What the promise was</p>
<p>To whom you made it</p>
<p>Whether it was easy or difficult to keep</p>
<p>And explain why you made it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to talk about a promise I made to my younger sister a few years ago. At the time, she was preparing for her final high school exams, and she was feeling extremely stressed and overwhelmed. She had always struggled with math, and she was worried that she wouldn’t be able to pass the exam. One evening, she came to me, almost in tears, and asked for my help. I promised her that I would tutor her every day until her exams and help her improve her math skills.</p>
<p>The promise was made to my sister, and it was someone I really cared about, so I felt a strong sense of responsibility to keep it. At first, I thought it would be easy because I was confident in my own math abilities, but it turned out to be more challenging than I expected. I had to sacrifice a lot of my free time to sit with her, explain concepts, and practice problems. There were moments when I felt frustrated because she didn’t grasp things as quickly as I hoped, but I reminded myself of the promise I had made and pushed through.</p>
<p>The reason I made this promise was because I could see how much it meant to her. She trusted me to help her, and I didn’t want to let her down. I also knew how important these exams were for her future, and I wanted to do everything I could to support her. In the end, she managed to pass her math exam with a decent grade, and she was incredibly grateful for my help. Seeing her relief and happiness made all the effort worthwhile.</p>
<p>This experience taught me the importance of keeping promises, especially when they involve someone who depends on you. It also strengthened my relationship with my sister, as she knew she could count on me when she needed help the most.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>1. Why do some people fail to keep their promises?</strong>
There are several reasons why people might fail to keep their promises. Sometimes, it’s due to unforeseen circumstances, such as sudden illness or emergencies, which make it impossible to follow through. Other times, people might overcommit themselves and realize they don’t have the time or resources to fulfill their promises. In some cases, a lack of sincerity or responsibility can also lead to broken promises, as individuals might make commitments without intending to keep them. Additionally, poor communication or misunderstandings can result in promises being unintentionally broken.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. Do children keep their promises?</strong>
Children often try to keep their promises, but their ability to do so depends on their age, maturity, and understanding of the commitment. Younger children might struggle to keep promises because they are still learning about responsibility and the importance of follow-through. For example, a child might promise to clean their room but get distracted by playing. However, as children grow older and develop a stronger sense of accountability, they are more likely to keep their promises, especially if they understand the consequences of breaking them.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. Do parents in China make promises to their children?</strong>
Yes, parents in China, like parents everywhere, often make promises to their children. These promises can range from small, everyday commitments, like buying a toy or taking them to the park, to more significant ones, such as rewarding good grades or planning a family vacation. Promises are often used as a way to motivate children or encourage positive behavior. However, Chinese parents generally emphasize the importance of keeping promises to teach their children about trust and responsibility, as these values are deeply rooted in Chinese culture.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>4. What kinds of promises do people often make?</strong>
People make a wide variety of promises depending on the context. In personal relationships, promises often revolve around emotional commitments, such as being supportive or staying loyal. In professional settings, promises might include meeting deadlines, delivering quality work, or fulfilling contractual obligations. On a daily basis, people might make smaller promises, like showing up on time or helping a friend with a task. Additionally, people often make promises to themselves, such as committing to a healthier lifestyle or learning a new skill. These promises reflect the values and priorities of individuals in different aspects of life.</p>

<p>Describe a line (or a few words) that you remember from a poem or song</p>
<p>You should say</p>
<p>What it is</p>
<p>Which song or poem it is from</p>
<p>How you knew it</p>
<p>And explain how you feel about it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One line that has always stayed with me is from Shakespeare’s <em>Sonnet 18</em>. The line is, <strong>“Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?”</strong> It’s the opening line of the sonnet, and it’s one of the most famous lines in English literature. The poem itself is a beautiful tribute to the timeless beauty of a loved one, and this line sets the tone for the entire piece.</p>
<p>I first came across this poem in high school during an English literature class. We were studying Shakespeare, and our teacher had us analyze several of his sonnets. This one stood out to me because of its romantic and poetic language. I remember being struck by how simple yet profound the opening line was. It immediately draws you in and makes you curious about what the comparison will be.</p>
<p>The reason this line resonates with me so much is because of its elegance and universality. It’s a question that feels both personal and timeless, as if Shakespeare is speaking directly to the reader. I also love how it captures the fleeting beauty of summer and contrasts it with the eternal beauty of the person he’s describing. It’s a reminder of how powerful words can be in expressing emotions and ideas.</p>
<p>Whenever I think of this line, I feel a sense of admiration for Shakespeare’s ability to convey such deep feelings in just a few words. It also makes me appreciate the beauty of poetry and how it can connect people across time and cultures. Even though the poem was written centuries ago, its message still feels relevant and moving today.</p>

<li>Are you good at memorizing things?</li>
<li>Do you think children would like the rhythm of songs or poems? Why?</li>
<li>Do you think it is easier for children to learn a song or poem than adults? Why?</li>
<li>What can people learn from songs or poems?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1. Are you good at memorizing things?</strong>
I would say I’m fairly good at memorizing things, especially if they interest me or if I can connect them to something meaningful. For example, I find it easier to remember lyrics to songs I enjoy or facts related to topics I’m passionate about. However, I struggle with memorizing random or abstract information unless I use techniques like repetition, visualization, or creating associations. Overall, my ability to memorize depends on the context and how much effort I put into it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. Do you think children would like the rhythm of songs or poems? Why?</strong>
Yes, I think children are naturally drawn to the rhythm of songs and poems because it makes the content more engaging and fun. The repetitive and melodic nature of rhymes and rhythms helps capture their attention and makes it easier for them to remember the words. For example, nursery rhymes or children’s songs often use simple, catchy patterns that appeal to young listeners. Additionally, the rhythm adds an element of playfulness, which aligns with children’s love for creativity and imagination.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. Do you think it is easier for children to learn a song or poem than adults? Why?</strong>
Yes, I believe it’s generally easier for children to learn songs or poems compared to adults. Children have a more flexible and receptive mind, which allows them to absorb new information quickly. They are also less self-conscious and more willing to engage with creative and repetitive activities, which aids memorization. On the other hand, adults might overthink or struggle to find time to practice due to their busy schedules. However, adults who are motivated or have a strong interest in music or poetry can still learn effectively.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>4. What can people learn from songs or poems?</strong>
People can learn a great deal from songs and poems, as they often convey emotions, stories, and cultural values. For example, songs and poems can teach us about history, traditions, and social issues, providing insights into different perspectives and experiences. They also help improve language skills, such as vocabulary, pronunciation, and rhythm. Additionally, songs and poems can inspire creativity, empathy, and self-expression, allowing people to connect with their own emotions and those of others. Overall, they are powerful tools for both education and personal growth.</p>

<p>What made you change the plan</p>
<p>What the new plan was</p>
<p>And how you felt about the change</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to talk about a recent change in my plans regarding my future career and education. This happened just last month when I was faced with a big decision about my next steps after graduating from college.</p>
<p>Originally, my plan was to start looking for a job right after graduation. I had already begun preparing my resume and researching companies in my field. However, last month, I attended a seminar about studying abroad, and it completely changed my perspective. The speaker shared their experiences of studying overseas, and I realized how much it could broaden my horizons, both academically and personally. After giving it some serious thought, I decided to change my plan and pursue a master’s degree abroad instead of entering the job market immediately.</p>
<p>The new plan involves applying to universities in countries like the UK or Canada, which are known for their excellent programs in my field. I’ve started preparing for language tests like IELTS and researching scholarships to fund my studies. It’s a big shift from my original plan, but I feel it’s the right decision for my long-term growth.</p>
<p>At first, I felt a bit anxious about the change because it meant stepping out of my comfort zone and delaying my entry into the workforce. However, as I started researching and talking to people who had studied abroad, I became more excited and confident about this new direction. I believe this change will open up more opportunities for me in the future, and I’m looking forward to the challenges and experiences that come with studying in a different country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Do people often change their plans?</strong>
Yes, people often change their plans due to various reasons. Sometimes, unexpected circumstances like bad weather, illness, or work emergencies can force them to adjust their schedules. Other times, people might change their plans because they find better alternatives or simply change their minds. For example, someone might decide to stay home instead of going out if they feel tired or if a more appealing opportunity arises. Flexibility is a natural part of life, and adapting to changes is essential for managing priorities effectively.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. Would you tell others if you change your plan?</strong>
Yes, but only to those who are directly affected by the change or are important to me. For instance, if I cancel a meeting with a friend, I would inform them immediately to avoid inconvenience. Similarly, if I change plans that involve family or colleagues, I would let them know as soon as possible. However, for plans that don’t impact others, I might not feel the need to share the change. Communication is key to maintaining trust and ensuring that everyone is on the same page.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. Why do you think parents still make plans for their children nowadays?</strong>
Parents often make plans for their children because they want to ensure their well-being and success. For example, they might plan their education, extracurricular activities, or even future careers to provide them with the best opportunities. Parents also make plans to instill discipline and structure in their children’s lives, which they believe will help them grow into responsible adults. Additionally, some parents might feel that their experience and knowledge can guide their children in making better decisions, especially in a competitive and fast-changing world.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>4. How does technology help people make plans?</strong>
Technology plays a significant role in helping people make and manage plans efficiently. For instance, calendar apps and reminder tools allow individuals to organize their schedules, set deadlines, and receive notifications about upcoming events. Communication platforms like email or messaging apps make it easy to coordinate plans with others, even across long distances. Additionally, travel and booking apps help people plan trips, accommodations, and activities seamlessly. Overall, technology simplifies the planning process and ensures that people can stay organized and informed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to talk about the air conditioner in my home, which is one of the most important pieces of equipment for me and my family. It’s a modern, energy-efficient unit that we installed a couple of years ago, and it has become an essential part of our daily lives.</p>
<p>We use the air conditioner almost every day, especially during the summer months when the temperature can get extremely high. Even in other seasons, we sometimes use it to maintain a comfortable indoor environment, particularly during humid or stuffy days. I’d say we rely on it heavily, especially during heatwaves when it’s almost impossible to stay indoors without it.</p>
<p>I usually use the air conditioner with my family. For example, in the evenings, we all gather in the living room, and the air conditioner helps us relax and enjoy our time together without feeling uncomfortable due to the heat. My parents and younger brother also appreciate having it in their rooms, as it allows them to sleep better at night.</p>
<p>The air conditioner is important to us for several reasons. First, it significantly improves our quality of life by keeping our home cool and comfortable, especially during extreme weather. Second, it helps us stay productive, as it’s difficult to focus on work or studies when it’s too hot. Lastly, it contributes to our health by reducing the risk of heat-related illnesses, which is particularly important for my grandparents, who live with us and are more sensitive to temperature changes.</p>
<p>Overall, the air conditioner is more than just a convenience—it’s a necessity for us, and we can’t imagine living without it.</p>

<p><strong>Describe an interesting building</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to talk about the Oriental Pearl TV Tower in Shanghai, which is one of the most iconic landmarks in China. Located in the Pudong district of Shanghai, it stands along the Huangpu River and is surrounded by other impressive skyscrapers, making it a central part of the city’s stunning skyline.</p>
<p>The Oriental Pearl TV Tower is a unique and futuristic-looking building. It’s incredibly tall, standing at 468 meters, and its design is inspired by a poem about pearls falling onto a jade plate. The tower consists of several large spheres at different levels, connected by vertical columns, which give it a distinctive and elegant appearance. At night, the tower is illuminated with colorful lights, making it even more striking and visually appealing.</p>
<p>The tower serves multiple functions. Primarily, it’s a TV and radio broadcasting tower, but it has also become a major tourist attraction. Inside, there are observation decks that offer breathtaking views of Shanghai, as well as a revolving restaurant where visitors can enjoy a meal while taking in the panoramic scenery. Additionally, the tower houses a museum dedicated to the history of Shanghai, which adds an educational element to its appeal.</p>
<p>What makes the Oriental Pearl TV Tower so interesting to me is its combination of architectural innovation, cultural significance, and functionality. It’s not just a building; it’s a symbol of Shanghai’s rapid development and modernization. Every time I visit, I’m amazed by how it blends art, technology, and history into one structure. It’s a must-see for anyone visiting Shanghai, and it never fails to leave a lasting impression.</p>

<p><strong>1. What types of buildings are popular in your country? (China ancient building)</strong>
In China, ancient buildings are highly popular and admired for their cultural and historical significance. Traditional Chinese architecture, such as palaces, temples, and courtyard homes, reflects the country’s rich heritage. For example, the Forbidden City in Beijing and the ancient water towns in Suzhou are iconic examples of Chinese architecture, featuring intricate designs, wooden structures, and symbolic elements like curved roofs and dragon motifs. These buildings are not only tourist attractions but also serve as a reminder of China’s artistic and engineering achievements throughout history.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. Is it worth spending a lot of money on the exterior appearance of a building?</strong>
Spending money on the exterior appearance of a building can be worth it, depending on the purpose and context. For iconic structures like museums, government buildings, or cultural landmarks, an impressive exterior can enhance their significance and attract visitors. However, for residential or functional buildings, it’s more important to balance aesthetics with practicality and cost-effectiveness. While a visually appealing exterior can create a positive impression, the focus should also be on durability, sustainability, and the building’s overall functionality.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. Is it more important for a building to look good on the outside or on the inside?</strong>
I believe the inside of a building is more important than the outside because it directly impacts the comfort and usability of the space. A well-designed interior ensures that the building meets the needs of its occupants, whether it’s for living, working, or leisure. For example, good lighting, ventilation, and layout are essential for creating a functional and pleasant environment. That said, the exterior appearance is also important, as it contributes to the building’s identity and can influence people’s perceptions. Ideally, a balance between the two should be achieved.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>4. Why do people like to visit historical sites?</strong>
People visit historical sites for various reasons. Firstly, these sites offer a glimpse into the past, allowing visitors to learn about history, culture, and traditions. For example, exploring ancient ruins or castles can provide insights into how people lived centuries ago. Secondly, historical sites often have unique architectural and artistic value, making them visually captivating. Additionally, visiting such places can evoke a sense of connection to one’s heritage or inspire awe at human achievements. Lastly, historical sites are often surrounded by stories and legends, which add an element of intrigue and fascination.</p>

<p>Describe a TV series you like
You should say:
What is the name of the TV series

<blockquote>
<p>Mysterious lotus casebook（莲花楼，武装古侠悬疑剧）</p>
<p>I’d like to talk about a TV series called <em>Mysterious Lotus Casebook</em>, which is a Chinese historical mystery drama. I watched it earlier this year, and it quickly became one of my favorite shows because of its intriguing plot and well-developed characters.</p>
<p>The series is set in ancient China and follows the story of a brilliant but enigmatic detective who solves complex cases while uncovering secrets from his own past. Each episode features a new mystery, often involving martial arts, political intrigue, and unexpected twists. The main character, who is both a skilled martial artist and a sharp-minded investigator, is accompanied by a group of loyal friends who help him navigate the challenges he faces. The show combines elements of action, suspense, and emotional depth, making it highly engaging.</p>
<p>I like this series for several reasons. First, the storytelling is excellent—each case is carefully crafted, and the pacing keeps you hooked from start to finish. Second, the characters are very relatable and multi-dimensional, which makes it easy to connect with their struggles and triumphs. I particularly admire the main character’s intelligence and resilience, as well as the strong bonds he shares with his companions. Finally, the production quality is outstanding, with beautiful costumes, stunning cinematography, and well-choreographed fight scenes that add to the overall appeal.</p>
<p>What makes <em>Mysterious Lotus Casebook</em> stand out to me is its ability to blend mystery, action, and emotional storytelling seamlessly. It’s not just about solving cases; it’s also about exploring themes like friendship, loyalty, and redemption. Watching this series feels like going on an adventure, and I always look forward to the next episode.</p>

<p><strong>1. Is it beneficial to insert advertisements within a TV series?</strong>
Inserting advertisements within a TV series can be beneficial for broadcasters and advertisers, but it often disrupts the viewing experience for the audience. For broadcasters, ads generate revenue, which helps fund the production of high-quality content. Advertisers also benefit by reaching a large and engaged audience. However, for viewers, frequent ad breaks can be frustrating, especially during intense or emotional scenes. While ads are necessary for the industry, finding a balance between commercial interests and viewer satisfaction is crucial.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. Do you think that parents should limit their children from watching television?</strong>
Yes, I believe parents should limit their children’s television time to ensure a healthy balance between screen time and other activities. Excessive TV watching can lead to issues like reduced physical activity, poor sleep quality, and exposure to inappropriate content. However, television can also be educational if children watch age-appropriate programs that stimulate their curiosity and learning. Parents should set reasonable limits and encourage alternative activities, such as reading, playing outdoors, or engaging in creative hobbies, to promote overall development.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. Would your family watch TV together?</strong>
Yes, my family occasionally watches TV together, especially during special occasions or when there’s a program that interests everyone. For example, we might watch a popular reality show, a sports event, or a movie during weekends or holidays. Watching TV together provides an opportunity for bonding and shared enjoyment. However, due to busy schedules and differing preferences, it’s not something we do every day. When we do, it’s a relaxing and enjoyable way to spend quality time as a family.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>4. What are the differences in television viewing habits between the elderly and young people?</strong>
There are significant differences in television viewing habits between the elderly and young people. Elderly individuals often prefer traditional TV channels and watch programs like news, dramas, or documentaries at scheduled times. They tend to value the routine and familiarity of linear TV. On the other hand, young people are more likely to use streaming platforms like Netflix or YouTube, where they can watch content on demand and binge-watch entire series. They also prefer genres like reality shows, comedies, or online videos, reflecting their desire for convenience and entertainment tailored to their interests.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>5. How has technology changed the way people watch television?</strong>
Technology has revolutionized the way people watch television by introducing on-demand streaming, personalized content, and multi-device accessibility. Platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ allow viewers to watch their favorite shows anytime, anywhere, without being tied to a TV schedule. Smart TVs and devices like Roku or Chromecast have made it easier to access a wide range of content. Additionally, social media and recommendation algorithms help users discover new shows based on their preferences. Overall, technology has made television viewing more flexible, interactive, and user-centric.</p>

<p>Describe someone who is willing to openly share things with you
You should say:
Who this person is
How you knew this person
What this person openly shares
And how you feel about the sharing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to talk about my friend Annie, who is one of the most open and generous people I know. She’s always willing to share her thoughts, experiences, and even personal belongings with me, which makes our friendship very special.</p>
<p>I first met Annie in high school. We were in the same class and quickly became close because of our shared interests in music and books. Over time, we developed a strong bond, and I realized that Annie is someone who values honesty and openness in relationships. She’s the kind of person who doesn’t hold back when it comes to sharing her feelings or opinions, and I really admire that about her.</p>
<p>Annie openly shares a lot of things with me. For example, she often talks about her personal experiences, including her struggles and achievements, which has helped me understand her better and learn from her life lessons. She’s also very generous with her time and resources—whether it’s lending me her favorite books, sharing her notes when I miss a class, or even offering advice when I’m going through a tough time. Her willingness to share extends beyond material things; she’s always there to listen and provide emotional support whenever I need it.</p>
<p>I feel incredibly grateful for Annie’s openness and generosity. Her willingness to share has not only strengthened our friendship but also taught me the importance of being open and supportive in return. It’s rare to find someone who is so genuine and selfless, and I truly value the trust and connection we’ve built over the years. Annie’s sharing has made a positive impact on my life, and I’m lucky to have her as a friend.</p>

<p><strong>1. What kinds of emotional support do people need at work?</strong>
People need various types of emotional support at work to maintain their well-being and productivity. For example, they might need encouragement and recognition for their efforts, especially during challenging projects or stressful periods. A supportive work environment where colleagues and managers listen to their concerns and offer constructive feedback is also crucial. Additionally, flexibility and understanding during personal difficulties, such as family issues or health problems, can make a significant difference. Emotional support helps employees feel valued, motivated, and less overwhelmed, which ultimately benefits both the individual and the organization.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. Would you share your feelings with your coworkers?</strong>
It depends on the situation and the level of trust I have with my coworkers. If I’m close to them and feel comfortable, I might share my feelings, especially if it’s related to work stress or a collaborative project. However, I would be cautious about oversharing personal emotions, as maintaining professionalism is important in the workplace. In general, I believe open communication can strengthen teamwork and create a supportive atmosphere, but it’s essential to strike a balance and respect boundaries.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. Is it possible to know a job applicant's emotional resilience through the recruiting process?</strong>
Yes, to some extent, it is possible to assess a job applicant’s emotional resilience during the recruiting process. For example, behavioral interview questions that ask about past challenges and how they were handled can provide insights into their ability to cope with stress and adversity. Additionally, situational judgment tests or role-playing exercises can reveal how candidates manage pressure and solve problems in real-time. However, emotional resilience is complex and may not be fully understood until the person is actually in the role and facing day-to-day challenges.</p>
