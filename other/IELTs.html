<p>套用题目：famous role model，well-known people in your country</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’d like to talk about Sun Yingsha, who is one of the most well-known athletes in China today. She’s a phenomenal table tennis player, and she’s gained widespread recognition, especially after her impressive performance in the 2024 Paris Olympics. Sun Yingsha has become a household name in China, not just because of her exceptional skills, but also because of her dedication, sportsmanship, and relentless pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>At the Paris Olympics, Sun Yingsha had a remarkable run. She won a gold medal in mixed doubles, a gold medal in the women’s team event, and a silver medal in the women’s singles category. The mixed doubles gold was particularly significant because it was the first-ever mixed doubles gold medal for the Chinese table tennis team. This achievement was historic, and it cemented her status as one of the greatest table tennis players of her generation.</p>
<p>What really impresses me about Sun Yingsha is her determination and focus on the game. She’s known for her incredible agility, quick reflexes, and powerful shots. Watching her play is truly inspiring because she always gives it her all, whether it’s a national competition or the Olympic finals. Despite being under immense pressure, she maintains a calm demeanor, which is something I really admire.</p>
<p>Beyond her skills on the table, Sun Yingsha is also admired for her humility. Despite her numerous achievements, she remains grounded and always credits her teammates and coaches for her success. This attitude has won her a lot of fans, not just in China but around the world. She often emphasizes the importance of teamwork and mutual support, which is evident in her dedication to the women’s team events.</p>
<p>Her popularity in China goes beyond just sports enthusiasts. She has become a symbol of perseverance and excellence, especially for the younger generation. Many young athletes look up to her as a role model because she shows that with hard work, anything is possible. In addition to her Olympic achievements, she has consistently been a top contender in various international table tennis competitions, showcasing her consistency and resilience.</p>
<p>All in all, Sun Yingsha is a true sports icon in China. Her remarkable achievements at the Paris Olympics, particularly the mixed doubles gold, which was a first for the Chinese team, have made her a source of national pride. I believe she will continue to inspire future generations with her incredible talent and unwavering dedication to the sport."</p>

<p>套用题目：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'd like to talk about a friend of mine, Anna, who I absolutely love talking to. We’ve known each other for about five years now, ever since we met in university, and over time, she’s become one of the people I cherish the most in my life. Whenever I need someone to talk to, whether it’s about something serious or just a lighthearted chat, Anna is always my go-to person.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I enjoy talking to her is because she’s such an attentive listener. No matter what I’m talking about, she always gives me her full attention, which is quite rare these days when people are often distracted by their phones. She doesn’t just listen passively either—she asks thoughtful questions and offers insightful advice. For example, there was a time when I was really struggling with making a career decision, and she helped me weigh the pros and cons without being pushy or judgmental. Her ability to understand my perspective and give me advice that’s actually helpful is something I truly appreciate.</p>
<p>Another reason I love our conversations is because we share similar interests, especially when it comes to books, movies, and current events. We often end up having deep discussions about the latest book we’ve read or a thought-provoking documentary we’ve watched. These conversations can sometimes last for hours, but it never feels like a waste of time because I always come away feeling inspired or having learned something new.</p>
<p>What I admire most about Anna is her sense of humor. Even when we’re talking about serious topics, she has this amazing ability to make me laugh. It’s not that she makes light of serious matters, but rather, she knows how to add a touch of humor that lightens the mood. This is especially comforting when I’m feeling stressed or overwhelmed—she just has a way of turning my day around with her jokes and witty comments.</p>
<p>All in all, talking to Anna is something I genuinely look forward to because it’s not only enjoyable but also meaningful. I always feel understood, supported, and uplifted after our conversations. It’s a rare thing to have someone in your life with whom you can talk about almost anything, and I consider myself lucky to have a friend like her."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One family member I would really like to work with in the future is my  <strong>cousin</strong>. She's not only a family member but also someone I deeply admire and look up to. My cousin has always been an incredibly organized and creative person, and over the years, I’ve seen her develop these skills into something truly professional. Currently, she works as a <strong>graphic designer</strong> for a well-known agency, and I've always been fascinated by her work.</p>
<p>The reason I would like to work with her is that we both share a passion for <strong>creative projects</strong>. I have some skills in writing and content creation, so I think we would complement each other quite well if we started a business together. For instance, I imagine we could run a small <strong>design and marketing firm</strong>, where she could handle the visual elements, while I focus on writing content, managing social media, and marketing strategies. It’s something we’ve casually discussed a few times, and I believe our combined skills would make for a solid partnership.</p>
<p>Moreover, my cousin is someone who is <strong>extremely disciplined</strong> and has a strong work ethic, which I think would be a great influence on me. She's always been the kind of person who plans things meticulously, whether it’s a project deadline or even a family event. This kind of structured approach to work is something I could definitely learn from. On the other hand, I’m a bit more spontaneous and flexible, so I think we would balance each other out quite well.</p>
<p>Another reason I’d love to collaborate with her is that working with a family member, especially someone I’m close to, would make the experience more enjoyable. I imagine it would create a sense of <strong>trust and openness</strong>, which can be hard to find when working with colleagues you don’t know as well. Of course, there could be challenges, such as <strong>mixing family and business</strong>, but I think our strong communication skills would help us overcome any potential conflicts.</p>
<p>In the future, if the opportunity arises, I would definitely love to <strong>start a creative venture</strong> with my cousin. It’s something that excites me, and I believe it would not only strengthen our relationship but also help both of us grow professionally.</p>

<p>So, my little nephew was only 8 or 9 years old at that time, and he just got 
a new puzzle for his birthday. It was a big one, probably 200 pieces. So, 
obviously, it was a bit of a challenge for him.
My cousin and his wife were cooking in the kitchen, and they left me and 
my nephew in the living room. In the beginning, the little boy was trying to 
show off（显摆） by putting the puzzle together all by himself. But very 
soon, he realized that it was a “mission impossible”（不可能的任务）. So, he</p>
<p>turned to（求助于我） me. I saw those puppy eyes（狗狗眼，可怜巴巴的），I
couldn’t say NO, and I decided to give him a hand（帮一把） and teach him 
the logic behind assembling a puzzle.
In terms of how I helped him, basically, I helped him by teaching him the 
logic of doing a puzzle. I told him to always start from finding the corner 
pieces（四角的块块） and the edge pieces（四条边线上的块块）. That would 
set the stage（铺垫前景） and make things much easier（让事情变得简单）. 
So, together, we picked out the four corner pieces first, and, bit by bit, we 
hunted down（找到） all the edge pieces, lining them up（连成一条直线） to 
frame the whole picture. My nephew got the hang of it（找到感觉，上手）
pretty quick, his little hands moving faster with each piece he placed. I was 
just there to tell him in the right direction from time to time. Then, piece 
by piece, the image started to come alive（呈现出来）, and you could tell he 
was really proud of what he was achieving. By the time we put in the last 
piece, the whole picture looked awesome. It put a big smile on his smile
（让他很开心）.
He couldn’t thank me enough（非常感谢）. I felt quite happy that I helped 
him and taught him some new skills. I enjoyed the feeling of “imparting 
knowledge”（传输知识） and also being the super hero for my little nephew</p>

<p>Today, I’d like to talk about an invention that has become incredibly useful in my life: online payment systems.

It includes various platforms like mobile banking apps, digital wallets, and payment systems like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and others.</p>
<p>I first started using online payments a few years ago, and it’s made my life so much easier and more efficient. In the past, whenever I needed to pay bills or make purchases, I had to visit physical stores or banks, which was time-consuming, especially with long queues.

Whether it's paying for groceries, ordering food delivery, or booking a taxi, I can do it instantly without needing cash or even a physical card.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages for me is the convenience. It saves so much time, especially since I’m always on the go. I can transfer money to friends or family, pay my utility bills, and even shop online at any time, whether it’s during the day or late at night. Also, these systems are highly secure, with encryption and two-factor authentication, so I don’t worry much about fraud.</p>
<p>Another thing I appreciate about online payments is how they make traveling simpler. I don’t have to carry large amounts of cash when I’m in a foreign country. I can just use my phone to pay for things, which is really helpful and reduces the hassle of currency exchange.</p>
<p>Overall, I would say online payments have made my life more convenient, efficient, and secure. It’s hard to imagine going back to the old days when I had to withdraw cash from ATMs or write checks.

<p>题目：惊喜之事</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most surprising and happiest moments I've experienced was when I received a <strong>birthday cake from my boyfriend</strong> at the time. This happened about two years ago, and I still remember it vividly because it was such an unexpected yet touching gesture.</p>
<p>To give you some context, my boyfriend and I were in a <strong>long-distance relationship</strong> back then. My birthday was approaching, and honestly, I wasn’t expecting much since we couldn't be together in person. I had planned to just spend the day quietly with a few close friends. However, on the morning of my birthday, there was a knock on my door, and to my absolute surprise, there was a <strong>beautifully decorated cake</strong> waiting for me.</p>
<p>What made this surprise so special was the effort he put into it. It wasn’t just any store-bought cake—it was <strong>handcrafted and customized</strong> with my favorite flavors and decorations. Apparently, he had coordinated with a local bakery near where I lived to make sure it was delivered on my birthday. The cake had a small note attached, expressing how much he missed me and wished he could be there to celebrate with me in person.</p>
<p>Receiving that cake was incredibly heartwarming and truly made my day. At that moment, I felt a surge of <strong>happiness and appreciation</strong> because I realized just how much he cared. It wasn't just the cake itself but the thoughtfulness behind the gesture that made it so memorable. To be honest, I was almost moved to tears because it was the last thing I was expecting.</p>
<p>Sadly, we eventually <strong>broke up</strong> due to the challenges of maintaining a long-distance relationship. However, looking back, that surprise is still one of the fondest memories I have. It not only made me happy but also reminded me that even small gestures can have a significant impact on someone’s emotions.</p>
<p>Even now, whenever I think about that birthday, I can’t help but smile. It was a simple but meaningful surprise that showed me how thoughtful he was, even if things didn't work out between us in the end.</p>

<p>题目：壮志未酬</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An ambition that I haven't yet achieved is <strong>securing an internship</strong> during my last summer holiday. I had been really eager to gain some practical work experience before graduating, so I set a goal for myself to find an internship in my field of study. However, despite my best efforts, things didn’t quite go as planned.</p>
<p>To prepare for this, I spent a significant amount of time <strong>polishing my CV</strong> and writing tailored cover letters. I wanted to make sure that my application stood out, so I highlighted my academic achievements, extracurricular activities, and any relevant skills I had acquired. Once I felt confident with my resume, I started sending it out to various companies, hoping to land a position that would align with my career goals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite applying to numerous companies and positions, I faced a lot of <strong>rejections</strong>. Some companies didn’t respond at all, while others sent polite but <strong>discouraging emails</strong>, stating that they had decided to move forward with other candidates. It was quite disappointing, especially since I had invested so much time and effort into the application process. I even reached out to a few contacts and alumni for advice and potential referrals, but it still didn’t work out.</p>
<p>One of the challenges I encountered was the fact that many companies preferred candidates with <strong>prior experience</strong>, which created a sort of paradox: I needed experience to get the internship, but I needed the internship to gain experience. This was definitely frustrating and made me question my own abilities at times.</p>
<p>Despite not achieving this goal, I’ve tried to look at the situation positively. I realized that setbacks like these are part of the journey and can be <strong>valuable learning experiences</strong>. I’ve learned to handle rejection better and have a clearer understanding of how competitive the job market can be. This experience has motivated me to <strong>enhance my skills</strong> even further, whether it’s by taking online courses or participating in workshops, so that I can be better prepared for future opportunities.</p>
<p>I’m still determined to find an internship or some practical experience in my field before I graduate. I plan to <strong>start my search earlier</strong> next time, expand my network, and perhaps explore opportunities in smaller companies or startups where the competition might not be as fierce. I believe that if I stay persistent and continue to improve my skill set, I will eventually achieve this ambition.</p>

<p>"I'd like to talk about a time when I used my smartphone to do something really important. This happened just a few months ago during an online academic lecture. It was an important session for one of my courses, and I was relying on my laptop to take notes. But, unfortunately, halfway through the lecture, my laptop suddenly ran out of battery. I hadn’t realized it was so low, and I didn’t have my charger with me at that moment.</p>
<p>At first, I panicked because I didn’t want to miss any critical information from the lecture. It was a session led by a guest lecturer, so I knew it wasn’t something that would be easily repeated. That’s when I decided to use my smartphone to salvage the situation. I quickly joined the lecture from my phone and, without wasting any time, switched to using the notes app to jot down key points.</p>
<p>What really surprised me was how effective my phone turned out to be for taking notes. Of course, the screen was much smaller than my laptop’s, but the phone’s keyboard was responsive, and I was able to type relatively quickly. I even found it convenient to use voice typing for some parts, which allowed me to capture information even faster. Additionally, I could switch between apps seamlessly to check references and details the lecturer mentioned during the talk.</p>
<p>In the end, I managed to take detailed notes without missing much of the lecture, which was a huge relief. I was actually proud of myself for staying calm and adapting to the situation. I realized that my phone is more than just a device for communication or entertainment; it’s a powerful tool that can be incredibly useful in unexpected situations.</p>
<p>After that experience, I made it a habit to keep my phone fully charged during important events, and I’ve even started using it more often for taking notes or accessing online resources when I’m on the go. It was a lesson in being resourceful and making the most of what I had at the moment. It might have been a small incident, but it definitely left a lasting impression on how versatile smartphones can be for academic purposes."</p>

<p>turning point</p>
<p>"I’d like to talk about a time when one of my close friends came to me for advice about a difficult decision she was facing. It happened last year when she was really struggling in her relationship and was torn about whether to break up with her boyfriend or not. She asked me for my honest opinion, and after hearing her out, I suggested that she end the relationship.</p>
<p>My friend had been with her boyfriend for nearly three years, but during that time, she often felt conflicted. On one hand, she told me he was funny, charming, and could always make her laugh. She appreciated his sense of humor and charisma, which had initially drawn her to him. But on the other hand, she described him as controlling and overly domineering. He constantly wanted things to go his way and pressured her to always agree with him. It was clear that he was quite bossy and had a very macho attitude.</p>
<p>As my friend shared all this with me, she was obviously distressed. She explained that she felt suffocated in the relationship because he expected her to follow his commands, which didn’t align with her independent nature. I could see how this was affecting her mental and emotional well-being. She was hesitant about making a decision because they had been together for so long, and she felt that ending things might be too drastic. But at the same time, she was unhappy and didn’t feel like she could truly be herself around him.</p>
<p>After listening to her, I told her that if the relationship was making her miserable, it was probably better for her to walk away. I reminded her that staying in a relationship out of fear of being alone is never a good reason. She needed to prioritize her own happiness and mental health. Although it was a tough suggestion to make, I believed it was the right call.</p>
<p>In the end, she decided to take my advice and broke up with him. The breakup was really hard on her at first because her ex-boyfriend kept trying to reach out, calling her and asking to meet. I remember she had a hard time resisting the urge to answer his calls, but she stayed strong and eventually cut off all communication. After several months, he finally stopped contacting her, and she began to heal.</p>
<p>Now, she often tells me how grateful she is for my advice. She feels much lighter and happier without the constant stress he brought into her life. While it wasn’t easy for her to go through, she now realizes it was the right thing to do. Seeing her in a much better place now confirms that sometimes, giving difficult advice is necessary, even if it’s hard for someone to hear."</p>

<p>"I’d like to talk about a time when the <strong>kitchen faucet</strong> in our home broke, and I managed to fix it on my own. It wasn’t anything too complicated, but it was definitely a challenge at first, especially since I had never attempted any plumbing repairs before.</p>
<p>One day, while I was washing dishes, I noticed that the faucet was leaking, and water kept dripping even after turning it off completely. This was not only wasteful but also pretty annoying, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. At first, I thought about asking my parents to call a plumber, but then I figured it would be a good learning experience to try and fix it myself.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was watch a couple of <strong>tutorial videos</strong> online to understand the basics of how a faucet works and what might be causing the issue. After some research, I realized that the problem was most likely a <strong>worn-out washer</strong> inside the faucet. Luckily, we had a set of basic tools and some spare washers at home.</p>
<p>I turned off the water supply and carefully unscrewed the faucet handle. I was a bit nervous at first, worried that I might make the problem worse, but I managed to remove the faulty washer and replace it with a new one. Once I put everything back together and turned on the water supply again, I was thrilled to see that the leak had stopped!</p>
<p>Honestly, fixing the faucet gave me a real sense of accomplishment. It wasn’t just about saving the cost of hiring a professional, but also about gaining the confidence to handle small repairs around the house. Plus, it felt good to be able to contribute to maintaining our home, especially since I’m usually not very handy with tools.</p>
<p>In conclusion, what started as a minor household inconvenience turned into a valuable learning experience. It made me realize that with the right resources and a bit of patience, even a teenager like me can handle simple repairs."</p>

<p>题目：提高注意力 something helps you concentrate on study</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’d like to talk about a <strong>technique</strong> that has really helped me stay focused during my studies, and that’s using the <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong>. It might sound simple, but it has had a huge impact on my productivity. Essentially, this method involves breaking down my study time into <strong>25-minute intervals</strong>, known as 'Pomodoros', followed by a short 5-minute break. After four cycles, I take a longer break, usually around 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I discovered this technique a couple of years ago when I was struggling to stay concentrated while preparing for a major exam. I noticed that whenever I tried to study for long hours without breaks, my mind would start wandering, and I would become easily distracted. However, once I started using the Pomodoro Technique, it was like a game-changer for me. Knowing that I only have to focus for 25 minutes at a time makes the task seem more manageable, and the short breaks help me recharge mentally.</p>
<p>What I find particularly effective about this method is that it helps me maintain a <strong>high level of focus</strong> during those short bursts of time. I often turn off my phone and eliminate any distractions during each session. Surprisingly, I can accomplish much more in those concentrated intervals than when I try to study for hours on end without a clear structure. The breaks also prevent me from feeling burnt out, allowing me to sustain my energy levels throughout the day.</p>
<p>Besides, the Pomodoro Technique helps me stay motivated because it adds a sense of urgency. I try to challenge myself to complete a specific task before the timer runs out, which keeps me engaged. Additionally, after a few cycles, I reward myself with something small, like a cup of coffee or a quick walk, which helps me stay refreshed and ready to continue.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this simple yet effective technique has greatly improved my ability to concentrate and manage my time efficiently. It’s definitely something I would recommend to anyone struggling to stay focused, whether it’s for studying or even working on other projects."</p>

<p>题目：去过的乡村</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’d like to talk about a trip I once took to the countryside outside of St. Petersburg, Russia. It was during the summer a few years ago when I had the opportunity to visit this serene and picturesque area. As you might know, the outskirts of St. Petersburg are filled with lush green landscapes, dense forests, and a series of tranquil lakes, which are especially beautiful in the warmer months.</p>
<p>The place I visited was a small village called Pavlovsk, about an hour’s drive from the city. It’s famous for its stunning imperial park and palace, which were once the summer residence of the Russian Tsars. The village itself had an old-world charm, with quaint wooden houses, gardens bursting with colorful flowers, and narrow, winding roads. It was such a refreshing change from the busy and bustling city life of St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>What struck me most about the countryside there was how peaceful and quiet it was. As I walked along the park’s shaded paths, I could hear nothing but the rustle of leaves and birds chirping. The air was incredibly fresh, and the scent of pine trees and wildflowers was everywhere. I remember taking a boat ride on the park’s lake, surrounded by tall birch trees reflected in the calm, mirror-like water. It felt like I was stepping back in time to a simpler, more relaxed era.</p>
<p>I also had the chance to interact with some of the locals, who were warm and welcoming. They even invited me to try some traditional Russian dishes, like blini and borscht, made from fresh ingredients grown in their gardens. This experience made the trip even more memorable because it gave me a glimpse into their way of life, which is so deeply connected to nature.</p>
<p>Overall, visiting the countryside near St. Petersburg was a truly unforgettable experience. It gave me a much-needed break from the city’s fast-paced environment and allowed me to immerse myself in the natural beauty and history of the area. I would love to go back one day, especially in autumn when the leaves change color, as I imagine it would be even more breathtaking."</p>

<p>题目：traffic jam</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’d like to talk about a time when I was stuck in a traffic jam, but it wasn’t the typical car traffic you might imagine. This happened on my university campus, and it involved electric bikes rather than cars. Since I'm a student, I commute to different classes on my electric bike every day because our campus is quite large. There’s a long break between classes, and during this time, many students, including myself, need to move between buildings. Unfortunately, this often leads to a chaotic situation.</p>
<p>The main issue is that there’s only one main road connecting the east and west sides of the campus, and it's the shortest route. Taking any other path would be three times longer, so naturally, everyone prefers using this route. One day, I had a class in a building on the west side, and I had just finished a class in the east. As soon as the break started, I jumped on my bike and headed towards the other building.</p>
<p>However, as soon as I reached the main road, I found myself stuck in a bike traffic jam. There were dozens, if not hundreds, of students on electric bikes, all trying to use the same narrow path at the same time. The university guard was trying to manage the flow, but many students were impatient and didn’t listen to his instructions. This only made the situation worse, as everyone was trying to squeeze through, making the road even more congested.</p>
<p>I was frustrated because I knew I was running late. At one point, we were all at a standstill, unable to move forward or backward. When the traffic finally started moving again, I still had to struggle to find a parking spot near my class building. Most of the parking spaces were already full, so I ended up circling around, wasting even more time. In the end, I arrived five minutes late for my class, which was quite embarrassing.</p>
<p>Looking back, it was a stressful experience, but it also taught me to plan my commute better during those peak times. Now, if I know I have back-to-back classes in different buildings, I try to leave a bit earlier to avoid getting stuck in that bike traffic jam. It’s definitely one of those unique challenges of being a student on a large campus."</p>

<p>题目：学习中的积极建议</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’d like to share an experience from my senior high school years when my Chinese teacher gave me some invaluable advice that really helped me with my studies. At that time, I was struggling a lot with Chinese. No matter how hard I tried, my grades just weren’t improving. It was incredibly frustrating because I was putting in so much effort, yet I wasn’t seeing the results I hoped for.</p>
<p>One day, after receiving another disappointing test score, I stayed behind after class to talk to my Chinese teacher. She had noticed that I was feeling discouraged, so she invited me to have a conversation. I explained how I was constantly trying to memorize long passages, but somehow, my comprehension and exam scores weren’t getting any better.</p>
<p>She listened patiently and then gave me some really thoughtful advice that completely changed my approach. She told me that instead of focusing on rote memorization, I should focus more on understanding the themes, context, and literary techniques used in the texts. She encouraged me to read more critically, to think about the deeper meanings behind the passages, and to connect them with real-life experiences or historical contexts. She even suggested keeping a reading journal where I could write down my reflections after reading each text.</p>
<p>At first, I was a bit skeptical because I had always relied on memorization to get through exams. But I decided to give her method a try. I started analyzing the texts more thoughtfully, trying to grasp the author’s intention and the cultural background. I also began writing summaries in my own words and jotting down any insights I had while reading.</p>
<p>Gradually, I started to see a change. Not only did my grades improve, but I also found that I enjoyed studying Chinese literature much more. The advice my teacher gave me made me realize that true learning is about understanding, not just memorizing. This shift in mindset not only helped me in Chinese but also in other subjects as well, where I began applying the same principles.</p>
<p>In the end, that conversation with my Chinese teacher was a turning point for me. It taught me that sometimes, it’s not about working harder but about working smarter. I’m really grateful for her advice because it helped me regain my confidence in my studies and changed my perspective on learning. Her positive encouragement and practical guidance are something I still carry with me today."</p>

<p>题目：一次非常忙碌的经历</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’d like to talk about a time when I was extremely busy, which happened during the exams week in college last semester. It was one of the most stressful periods I’ve ever experienced because I had to prepare for nine exams, and I only had a week to do it. To be honest, I got myself into that situation because I had procrastinated on my review schedule and left everything until the last minute.</p>
<p>At the start of that week, I realized how much I needed to catch up on. Each subject required intensive preparation, and the topics were quite challenging. I was overwhelmed, but there was no time to waste, so I quickly created a strict study plan. I divided my time into blocks, dedicating several hours each day to each subject, and even sacrificed sleep to make more time for studying. There were days when I was up until 3 or 4 in the morning, only to wake up a few hours later and continue revising.</p>
<p>To make things even more stressful, all the exams were back-to-back with no breaks in between. I remember one particular day when I had two exams, one in the morning and another in the afternoon. As soon as I finished the first exam, I rushed to the library to cram for the next one. I had to juggle multiple textbooks, class notes, and online resources, trying to digest as much information as possible in a short time.</p>
<p>What made it even more difficult was that each subject required a different approach. For subjects like mathematics and physics, I had to focus on solving practice problems, while for literature and history, I had to memorize facts and analyze texts. I was mentally exhausted, but I kept pushing through because I knew I didn’t have any other option.</p>
<p>In the end, it was an exhausting week, but it paid off. I managed to get through all nine exams, and although I didn’t get perfect scores, I was able to pass them all with decent grades. The experience taught me a valuable lesson about time management and the importance of starting my preparation early. I realized that the stress and sleepless nights could have been avoided if I had been more disciplined with my study schedule from the beginning.</p>
<p>Looking back, it was definitely one of the busiest and most intense weeks of my college life. But it also showed me that when pushed to the limit, I’m capable of focusing and working hard under pressure. Now, I always try to plan ahead to avoid getting into such stressful situations again."</p>

<p>题目：花费甚少的外出日</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’d like to talk about a special day I had recently that cost me almost nothing, but it was truly memorable. This happened a few months ago when my friends and I decided to have a picnic at a nearby park. We were all feeling a bit overwhelmed with our studies and assignments, so we thought it would be a great idea to take a break and relax outdoors. Since we were all on a tight budget, we wanted to do something fun without spending much money.</p>
<p>We planned it quite simply. Each of us brought some homemade food, like sandwiches, fruit, and snacks. I made a batch of cookies from ingredients I already had at home, so it didn’t cost me anything extra. One of my friends brought a thermos of homemade iced tea, while another brought some fruits that were already in season. It was a perfect potluck-style picnic where everyone contributed something small.</p>
<p>On the day of the picnic, we headed to a large park near our university. The weather was perfect—it was sunny but not too hot, with a gentle breeze that made it really pleasant to sit outside. We found a nice shady spot under a big tree where we could spread out our blankets. We spent hours just chatting, laughing, and enjoying each other’s company. It felt so refreshing to be away from the usual hustle and bustle of daily life.</p>
<p>What made the day even more special was that we brought along some games. One of my friends brought a deck of cards, and we ended up playing card games and even a few rounds of charades. It was so much fun, and we were all laughing so hard that we completely lost track of time. At one point, we even took a short walk around the park, enjoying the beautiful scenery and the blooming flowers.</p>
<p>The best part about that day was that it didn’t cost us much at all. Apart from the small cost of the ingredients we used to make the food, everything else was completely free. It made me realize that sometimes, you don’t need to spend a lot of money to have a great time. What truly matters is the people you’re with and the quality of the time you spend together.</p>
<p>Looking back, it was one of the most enjoyable and relaxing days I’ve had in a long time. It reminded me that sometimes, the simplest things in life can bring the most joy. I think that’s a lesson I’ve carried with me ever since—that you can create beautiful memories without needing to splurge."</p>

<p>One activity I regularly do to stay fit is <strong>following an online streamer for exercise routines</strong>. I started this habit around a year ago when I realized I needed to improve my fitness level but didn't have the motivation to go to a gym or fitness class. The convenience of exercising at home with the guidance of a live streamer was a game-changer for me.</p>
<p>The streamer I follow specializes in <strong>HIIT workouts</strong>, which stand for High-Intensity Interval Training. These sessions typically last about 30 to 45 minutes and combine cardio exercises with strength training, which helps me not only burn calories but also build muscle. What I find particularly motivating is that the streamer often <strong>interacts with viewers</strong>, offering words of encouragement and answering questions in real-time. This interactive aspect makes the experience much more engaging than simply following a pre-recorded video.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I enjoy exercising this way is that it fits easily into my schedule. I can join the live stream whenever it's convenient for me, and if I miss a session, I can always watch the recording later. Plus, the <strong>variety of workouts</strong> keeps things interesting. The streamer mixes things up by incorporating different types of exercises, like yoga stretches or core workouts, so it never feels monotonous.</p>
<p>I've noticed significant benefits since I started these workouts. I’ve become more <strong>energetic</strong>, and my <strong>endurance</strong> has improved considerably. Additionally, it's been great for my <strong>mental health</strong>, especially when I’ve had a long, stressful day. Following along with someone who's both knowledgeable and enthusiastic really helps me stay consistent and motivated.</p>
<p>In the future, I’d like to explore other fitness routines, but for now, <strong>following this online streamer</strong> is definitely my favorite way to stay fit. It’s practical, effective, and, most importantly, enjoyable.</p>

<p>One of the most <strong>memorable events</strong> I celebrated recently was <strong>New Year’s Eve on December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2023</strong>, which coincided with an annual celebration called <strong>Student's Day</strong> on our university campus. This event is something I look forward to every year because it’s a unique combination of welcoming the new year and celebrating the vibrancy of student life.</p>
<p>The celebration is truly a full-day affair, packed with a variety of activities. The day began with a <strong>student parade</strong> in the morning. It was incredible to watch the students marching in colorful costumes, holding banners, and showcasing different performances representing various clubs and departments. The parade had a lively and festive atmosphere, and you could feel the energy and excitement in the air. Everyone was cheering, taking photos, and soaking in the festive spirit.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the campus was bustling with <strong>small games and competitions</strong> organized by different student organizations. I participated in a few games with my friends, like tug-of-war and a trivia quiz, which was a lot of fun. These activities brought everyone together, and it was a great way to bond with classmates and even make new friends. I especially enjoyed the friendly, competitive spirit that filled the air.</p>
<p>However, the highlight of the day was definitely the <strong>party performances</strong> held on the playground in the evening. As night fell, the entire campus was lit up with fairy lights and decorations, creating a magical ambiance. There were performances by student bands, dance groups, and even some comedy sketches, which had everyone laughing and clapping. The atmosphere was electric, especially when the clock struck midnight. Everyone gathered to count down to the new year, and the sky was suddenly filled with <strong>fireworks</strong>, lighting up the night.</p>
<p>What made this event so special was not just the celebration itself but also the feeling of <strong>togetherness</strong>. It was the perfect way to wrap up the year and welcome a new one surrounded by friends, laughter, and a sense of community. I felt genuinely happy and grateful to be a part of such a lively and positive environment.</p>
<p>This celebration will always hold a special place in my heart because it reminded me of the joy of being in college, surrounded by people who are not just classmates but a second family. It was a day full of <strong>fun, excitement, and unforgettable memories</strong>.</p>

<p>题目：成功组织一场活动</p>

<p>One event that I organized successfully was an <strong>icebreaker activity</strong> for a student society that I’m part of. This took place last semester when our society was welcoming new members, and we wanted to create a warm and friendly atmosphere where everyone could get to know each other better.</p>
<p>The idea of organizing this event came to me because I noticed that new members often felt a bit <strong>shy and hesitant</strong> to interact with others during our meetings. Since I was in charge of member engagement, I decided that an icebreaker activity would be the perfect way to help everyone feel more comfortable and connected right from the start.</p>
<p>To organize the event, I first spent some time <strong>researching fun and engaging icebreaker games</strong> that would be suitable for a group of around 30 people. I eventually settled on a mix of activities, such as "Two Truths and a Lie" and a team-based scavenger hunt. These games were chosen because they were interactive, easy to participate in, and didn’t require any special equipment, which made it practical given our limited resources.</p>
<p>Next, I planned out the logistics. I reserved a spacious room on campus, made sure we had all the necessary materials like notepads and small prizes for the winners, and even arranged for some <strong>snacks and refreshments</strong> to keep the energy levels high. I also created a schedule to ensure that everything ran smoothly, starting with a quick introduction, followed by the games, and ending with some free time for everyone to chat.</p>
<p>On the day of the event, I was a bit nervous about whether everything would go as planned. However, to my relief, the activities turned out to be a <strong>huge success</strong>. The new members were initially a bit reserved, but once the games began, everyone started laughing, interacting, and forming new friendships. The "Two Truths and a Lie" game was particularly effective because it encouraged people to share interesting facts about themselves, which led to some lively discussions.</p>
<p>The feedback I received afterward was overwhelmingly positive. Many members told me that the icebreaker activities helped them feel <strong>more at ease</strong> and excited to participate in future society events. This made me feel incredibly proud because I had achieved my goal of fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment.</p>
<p>In hindsight, organizing this event taught me a lot about <strong>planning and time management</strong>. It also boosted my confidence in my organizational skills, and I felt a great sense of accomplishment knowing that I had brought people together and helped create a sense of community. It’s definitely an experience I would love to repeat, and I’m already thinking of ways to make the next event even more engaging.</p>

<p>One skill that I learned from an older person is <strong>how to make rice dumplings</strong>, which I learned from my grandmother. In my culture, rice dumplings, or "zongzi" as we call them, are traditionally made to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival, and it's a skill that's been passed down through generations.</p>
<p>I first learned this skill a few years ago when I visited my grandmother during one of my school holidays. Growing up, I had always been fascinated by how she would so effortlessly wrap the dumplings with bamboo leaves, filling them with sticky rice, red beans, and pieces of marinated meat. So, one day, I asked her to teach me how to make them, and she was more than happy to pass on her knowledge.</p>
<p>The process was much more <strong>challenging</strong> than I had anticipated. First, my grandmother showed me how to <strong>soak the sticky rice overnight</strong> and prepare the fillings, making sure they were well-seasoned. The most difficult part, though, was <strong>folding the bamboo leaves into a neat triangular shape</strong> and securing them with string. My initial attempts were clumsy; the leaves would slip, and the filling would spill out. However, my grandmother was very patient. She guided me step by step, demonstrating how to fold the leaves tightly and tie the string so that the dumplings wouldn’t fall apart during boiling.</p>
<p>What I really appreciated about learning this skill from my grandmother was not just mastering the technique but also hearing the <strong>stories and traditions</strong> behind it. She shared how her mother taught her, and how, back in the day, families would gather to make these dumplings together, turning it into a cherished tradition. It made me realize that making rice dumplings isn’t just about the food itself, but also about <strong>family bonding and preserving cultural heritage</strong>.</p>
<p>Since learning this skill, I’ve tried making rice dumplings on my own a few times, especially during the Dragon Boat Festival, to share with friends and family. Although I’m not nearly as skilled as my grandmother, I’ve definitely improved. What makes me happiest is seeing the smiles on people’s faces when they taste the dumplings I've made—it’s a small way for me to <strong>keep our family tradition alive</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking back, I’m grateful for the time I spent with my grandmother learning this skill. It’s not just a practical cooking technique but also a <strong>connection to my roots</strong> and a way to honor the past. I hope to continue making rice dumplings and maybe one day pass on this skill to younger members of my family.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One memorable experience when I showed something new to someone younger than me was <strong>introducing my younger cousin</strong> to the basics of <strong>coding</strong>. This happened last summer when he visited me for a week during his school break. At that time, I had already been studying <strong>computer science</strong> in college, and my cousin, who is about 14 years old, had shown an interest in technology but had never tried coding before.</p>
<p>I decided to introduce him to <strong>Python</strong>, as it’s one of the easiest programming languages for beginners. I could see that he was really curious, so I thought it would be a great opportunity to share something useful and fun with him. To make it engaging, I planned a few simple projects that I thought he would enjoy, such as creating a basic <strong>quiz game</strong> and a simple program to draw shapes using Python’s turtle module.</p>
<p>At first, he was a bit overwhelmed by the <strong>syntax and commands</strong>, but I made sure to break everything down into simple steps. I explained how each line of code worked and encouraged him to try writing it himself. What really surprised me was how quickly he caught on. Within an hour, he was already experimenting with changing the code to customize the quiz questions and add new shapes to the drawing program. Seeing his excitement and creativity was incredibly rewarding for me.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, I tried to <strong>encourage him</strong> by emphasizing that making mistakes was a natural part of learning. I shared stories about how I had also struggled with coding when I first started and how perseverance was key. He seemed to appreciate hearing about my experiences, which made him more <strong>confident</strong> and willing to experiment on his own.</p>
<p>By the end of the week, he had not only completed the projects I had planned but also started exploring some <strong>online tutorials</strong> on his own. It was really fulfilling to see how something I had shared sparked a genuine interest in him. In fact, after returning home, he called me a few weeks later to show me a small game he had created all by himself.</p>
<p>This experience taught me that sharing knowledge can be incredibly <strong>rewarding</strong>. It’s not just about teaching someone a new skill, but also about inspiring them and <strong>nurturing their curiosity</strong>. I was really happy to see that I had made a positive impact on my cousin, and I realized that I enjoyed mentoring others. It even got me thinking about possibly pursuing a role in education or mentoring in the future.</p>

<p><strong>1. Percentage of population in living cities</strong></p>
<p>This line graph illustrates the proportion of urban citizens in Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia between 1970 and 2020, with the expected population in 2030 and 2040.</p>
<p>Overall, it can be easily seen from the graph that all four countries has a dramatic rise in population, starting at the lowest point in 1970 and being projected to reach the peak in 2040.</p>
<p>Malaysia starts at 30%, about twice as much as Indonesia. After that, both showed an obvious increase, with the former rising to approximately 76% in 2020, and the latter rising to approximately 50%. Both sides are expected to continue rising thereafter, with Malaysia slowly rising to about 83%, while Indonesia is expected to see a 12% gain.</p>
<p>The starting point of Philippines is about 31%, which is about 13% higher than Thailand. Over the next decade, the Philippines remained relatively stable. Between 1980 and 1990, the Philippines rose to about 48%, but fell to about 42% over the next 20 years. During this period, Thailand showed a gradual increase from 18% to approximately 30%. After 2010, both countries are expected to show an upward trend, rising to 55% and 49% respectively.</p>
<p><strong>2. Number of US household in millions by their annual income</strong></p>
<p>This bar chart illustrates the numbers of US household in millions by their annual income in 2007, 2011 and 2015 respectively.</p>
<p>Overall, it can be easily seen that households of $100000 or more climbs apparently and is the most, while other remain nearly steady, with $25000-$49999 the second, followed by less than $25000 and the $50000-$74999, and the $75000-$99999 the last.</p>
<p>From the graph, less than $25000 and $25000-$49999 first rise in 2011 and sightly fall in 2015, from 25 to 29 to 28 and 27 to 30 to 29 respectively. While $75000-$99999 and $100000 or more are the other way around, beginning at 14.5 and 29.5, decreasing to 14 and 27 and ending with 15 and 33. The middle bar, namely $50000-$74999 remains level in the three years, roughly 21.</p>
<p>In 2011, the bars of $25000-$49999 and less than $25000 exceed $100000 or more at a marginal edge. But the $100000 or more has witnessed a dramatic increase in 2015, approximately from the lowest point 27 to 33.</p>

<p><strong>1. The most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?</strong></p>
<p>The proposition that the most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives is a significant one, meriting thoughtful consideration. This essay will argue that, while the improvement of human lives is a crucial goal of science, it should not be viewed as its sole purpose.</p>
<p>Firstly, the advancement of human welfare through scientific discovery has undeniably been monumental. Medical science, for instance, has dramatically enhanced the quality and longevity of life. The development of vaccines, antibiotics, and advanced surgical techniques has transformed healthcare, drastically reducing mortality rates and improving the management of chronic diseases. Moreover, technological innovations, a product of scientific research, have reshaped daily life, offering unparalleled convenience and efficiency. The advent of the internet, smartphones, and smart home technology are prime examples of how science has made everyday tasks more accessible and interconnected.</p>
<p>However, the pursuit of science for the sheer expansion of knowledge should also be recognized as an essential aim. Many scientific endeavors, such as space exploration or the study of fundamental physics, may not have immediate practical applications but are crucial for our understanding of the universe. The pursuit of such knowledge can lead to unforeseen benefits. For example, the exploration of space has led to the development of satellite communication, GPS technology, and numerous other applications that have had a considerable impact on daily life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it's important to consider the ethical and societal implications of focusing solely on science that improves human life. Such a focus might lead to the neglect of crucial environmental or ecological research, which may not have direct benefits for humans in the short term but are essential for the sustainability of life on Earth. Additionally, this approach might bias funding and attention towards projects with immediate commercial benefits, potentially at the expense of basic science research.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while improving human lives is a vital goal of scientific endeavor, it should not be the only aim. The pursuit of knowledge for its own sake and the exploration of questions beyond immediate human concerns are equally important. This broader perspective ensures a balanced approach to science, where the pursuit of understanding and the betterment of humanity go hand in hand.</p>
<p><strong>2.Some university students want to learn about other subjects in addition to their main subjects. Others believe it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for a qualification.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. In many countries, people are now living longer than ever before. Some people say an ageing population creates problems for governments. Other people think there are benefits if society has more elderly people. To what extent do the advantages of having an ageing population outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></p>
<p>In the contemporary era, the phenomenon of an aging population has become increasingly prominent across the globe, thanks to advancements in medical technology and improvements in living standards. While some argue that this trend poses significant challenges to societies and governments, I contend that the benefits of an aging population far outweigh its disadvantages, heralding a more sustainable and wisdom-oriented future.</p>
<p>On the one hand, critics of demographic aging often highlight the economic and social strains it imposes. Primarily, the increasing number of elderly individuals elevates the demand for pensions and healthcare services, potentially straining public finances and placing a heavier burden on the younger working-age population. Furthermore, a shrinking workforce could lead to decreased productivity and economic stagnation. These concerns, while valid, overlook the evolving nature of modern economies and the adaptability of social systems.</p>
<p>Conversely, the advantages of an aging population are manifold and, in my opinion, eclipse the aforementioned challenges. Firstly, elderly individuals contribute significantly to society through the transfer of knowledge and skills, mentoring younger generations and fostering a culture of wisdom and experience. Their active participation in volunteer work and the informal economy also adds substantial value, often unaccounted for in traditional economic metrics.</p>
<p>Moreover, the aging demographic drives innovation and growth in critical sectors. The healthcare and eldercare industries, for example, are prompted to advance in terms of services and technologies, ranging from personalized medicine to smart home systems, thereby creating new employment opportunities and stimulating economic vitality. This not only enhances the quality of life for the elderly but also benefits society as a whole by accelerating technological and medical advancements.</p>
<p>Additionally, an aging society encourages a shift towards more sustainable living practices. As populations age, there tends to be a decrease in resource-intensive consumption patterns, aligning more closely with environmental sustainability goals. This demographic shift can thus act as a catalyst for societies to adopt greener lifestyles and policies, contributing to the global effort against climate change.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the aging population presents certain challenges, these are not insurmountable. With strategic planning and policy adjustments, societies can harness the potential benefits of this demographic trend. The wealth of experience and knowledge that older individuals offer, combined with the stimulus they provide for innovation and sustainability, underscores the positive aspects of an aging society. Therefore, it is clear that the advantages of having an aging population significantly outweigh the disadvantages, marking a pivotal step towards a more sustainable and enlightened future.</p>
<p><strong>4. In many countries around the world, rural people are moving to cities, so the population in the countryside is decreasing. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?</strong></p>
<p>In numerous nations worldwide, the trend of rural populations migrating to urban areas is prominent, leading to a dwindling number of inhabitants in the countryside. This shift, in my opinion, embodies a double-edged sword, reflecting the complex dynamics of societal evolution.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the allure of cities is undeniable. Urban centers, with their advanced infrastructure and abundant employment prospects, magnetize individuals seeking improved livelihoods. The superior quality of urban life, coupled with the automation of agricultural practices reducing rural labor demand, underscores the rationality behind this migration. Such developments signify progress, offering individuals the freedom to pursue a broader spectrum of opportunities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this influx into urban areas introduces several challenges. Skyrocketing housing prices, escalating traffic congestion, rising unemployment rates, and deteriorating living conditions due to pollution are immediate repercussions. Moreover, the urban expansion necessitates converting more land into cityscapes, potentially straining resources. The diminished rural workforce and reduced agricultural lands could hinder food production, highlighting a critical balance between consumption and production that must be maintained.</p>
<p>Yet, the phenomenon of urbanization is not a one-way street. The concept of reverse urbanization, where individuals return to rural areas seeking respite from urban chaos, illustrates a natural recalibration process. This cycle suggests that concerns regarding urban overpopulation and rural depopulation may eventually equilibrate.</p>
<p>Hence, viewing rural-to-urban migration through a binary lens of positive or negative oversimplifies its implications. This movement is an intrinsic aspect of societal advancement, where the intertwined challenges and benefits will ultimately pave the way for a balanced development.</p>
