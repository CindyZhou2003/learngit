> We had been together for about three years, and during that period of time, I was in two minds（犹豫，纠结） all the time. *On one hand*, he was funny and charming. He could really make me laugh. I loved his sense of humor （我喜欢他的幽默感） and his charisma. *On the other hand*, he was a control freak. He always wanted me to listen to him, and say yes to him. He really put a lot of pressure on me. I mean, I’m an independent person with an independent mind, so I couldn’t just blindly follow his commands（跟随他的指令）. He was very bossy（霸道的） and macho（大男子主义的）.
> I **was torn between**（很纠结） leaving and staying. I didn’t want to rush into the decision（匆忙做决定）, so I waited long enough because I wanted to give it a chance. After being together for three years, I was very unhappy, so I finally made up my mind（彻底下决定） to leave him. I told him about my decision. It wasn’t easy for me. I was crying and having a meltdown when I saw him for the last time. And he refused to take it. We were not **on the same page** at all（意见不一致，他不想分手）.
> After the breakup, in the beginning, he was still trying to influence my decision by constantly calling me and trying to see me. It was extremely difficult for me to not pick up the phone. But I pulled myself together（振作起来）. I didn’t give him any chances to talk to me. And eventually, after 6 months, he gave up.
> I’m now feeling so much better without him. Everything is water under the bridge（事情都过去了）. Even though I still miss him sometimes, I know it will all be over one day. Time will heal everything（时间会治愈一切）. It was a tough decision to make, but it was the right thing to do.

### village

> Although I was born and raised in Shanghai, a bustling city, I had the chance to visit a village during a trip to Chongming Island. It was a refreshing experience, as it felt completely different from the urban environment I’m used to.
>
> The village was small but incredibly peaceful, surrounded by lush greenery and open fields. There were narrow paths lined with trees, and many houses had traditional designs, with tiled roofs and whitewashed walls. What stood out to me the most was how quiet and calm everything was compared to the city’s constant noise and rush.
>
> During my visit, I spent time exploring the countryside, walking along the canals, and enjoying the fresh air. I even had the opportunity to taste some local food, including freshly harvested vegetables and homemade tofu, which were delicious and felt so natural. The villagers were warm and welcoming, and their simple lifestyle left a deep impression on me.
>
> Although my visit was brief, it gave me a glimpse of how life can be slower yet fulfilling. It also made me appreciate the beauty of nature and the importance of stepping away from the fast pace of city life every now and then.
