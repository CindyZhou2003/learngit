------

Throughout my academic journey, I have faced some challenges that, while initially daunting, have ultimately shaped my resilience and improved my ability. Mathematics was one of my early hurdles. During senior high school, I had no exposure to calculus like many peers, which left me feeling unprepared when I encountered it in college. 

I struggled to grasp the mathematical reasoning at first, reading textbooks again and again to acquire the knowledge and logic behind every question. Step by step, my effort finally paid off through my consistent practice though my mathematical abilities are still of average level.

Similarly, computer programming was another pivotal challenge for a freshman like me with no prior experience. I found the transition into programming to be a significant shift in thinking. Adapting to this new field demanded both time and dedication as I navigated unfamiliar coding syntax and computational logic. Despite the steep learning curve, I embraced the opportunity to learn, eventually developing a passion for problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. Through much time and effort, I think I gradually mastered computer programming.

These experiences have profoundly influenced my educational and professional development. They have taught me that challenges, despite the difficulty, are opportunities for growth and self-discovery. My journey from a novice programmer to someone doing cutting-edge research in deepfake detection exemplifies the rewards of hard work and adaptability. These lessons have not only prepared me for the rigors of graduate study but have also built my confidence to tackle complex problems and continuously strive for improvement.

2. At Illinois, we value a student’s ability to contribute to a community of inclusion, belonging, and respect where our graduate students can learn and collaborate productively and positively. Please provide an example of how you contributed to or engaged with a community of students or colleagues with different perspectives, abilities, and experiences to achieve a positive outcome and reflect on what you learned from this experience. (*250 words max*)

In my Fundamentals of Software Engineering course last semester, I was the leader of a group of 5 students. While we shared a common goal, my team members had distinct perspectives, personalities, and working habits. Thus, it was really a challenge for me as thoughtful coordination was required to ensure a productive and inclusive collaboration.

In the group, I found some team members were always readily sharing their ideas, while others were a bit shy. To create an environment where everyone felt valued, I encouraged quieter members to share their thoughts, ensuring their voices were heard and integrated into our discussions. This approach not only enriched our project with diverse insights but also fostered a sense of belonging within the group.

However, during the teamwork, one team member was initially disengaged, falling behind on his responsibilities. Regardless of the frustrating fact, I tried to iron out the issue with patience and understanding. Through open communication with my teammate, I sought to understand his perspectives, reset the goals to be more clear, and reschedule the deadlines to leave him enough time to finish his part. This proactive approach eventually worked a lot, making the whole project progress smoothly.

This experience taught me the importance of empathy, adaptability, and effective communication in collaboration among individuals with different strengths and working styles. By creating a united and inclusive atmosphere and addressing problems constructively, I not only helped our team succeed but also mastered practical skills that I will bring to future academic and professional communities.
