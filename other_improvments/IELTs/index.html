<p><strong>1. Paying bills</strong>
    What kind of bills do you have to pay?
    How do you usually pay your bills? Why?
    Is there anything you could do to make your bills cheaper?</p>
<h3 id="part-2">Part 2<a class="headerlink" href="#part-2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><strong>1. Describe a successful business person you know</strong> 
    you should say who's the person is
    how you knew him/her 
    what business he or she does 
    and explain why he or she is success</p>
<p><em>Ah, let's talk about a classic example: Steve Jobs. He's a well-known figure, the co-founder of Apple Inc. I never met him personally, but his story is quite famous. Jobs started Apple in a garage with his friend Steve Wozniak. Their big breakthrough was the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers.Jobs was known for his perfectionism, innovative mindset, and ability to foresee market trends. He wasn't just about technology; he cared deeply about design and user experience. This unique blend made Apple products not just gadgets but lifestyle statements.Despite facing setbacks – like being ousted from Apple in the 1980s – he returned in the 1990s, leading the company to create groundbreaking products like the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. He was successful because he wasn't afraid to take risks and he always pushed for what he believed in, even when others doubted him. Remember, "The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do." That's a quote from Jobs himself.</em></p>
<p><strong>2. Describe some food or drink that you learned to prepare</strong>
    what food or drink you learned to prepare
    when and where you learned
    how you learned
    and explain how you felt about learning to prepare</p>
<p><em>Learning to prepare a steak is an experience that I will always remember fondly. It all started twoyears ago when I decided to fry my hand at cooking a steak in my apartment kitchen. Havingalways enjoyed eating steaks, I was eager to learn how to prepare one myself.</em>
<em>To get started, I scoured the internet for helpful tips and tricks on cooking the perfect steak. I came across some popular celebrity chef videos, including Gordon Ramsay's tutorial on how tocook a steak. Watching his videos helped me get the hang of the cooking process and learn someessential techniques.</em>
<em>So, I headed to the local market and picked up a nice ribeye steak. Following Ramsay's advice, Iseasoned it generously with salt and pepper, rubbing it in to really bring out the flavor.</em>
<em>Next, I preheated a cast-iron skillet on high heat and added a pat of butter and a drizzle of oliveoil. Once the skillet was nice and hot, I carefully placed the steak on it, and the sizzling soundwas music to my ears. I let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, using tongs to turn it over and basting it with the melted butter to make it extra juicy and delicious.</em>
<em>Once the steak was done, I took it off the skillet and let it rest on a cutting board for a few minutesto let the juices redistribute and make it even more tender. Then, I sliced it against the grain intothin slices and served it up with some tasty vegetables, including crisp-tender asparagus andmushrooms.</em>
<em>Overall, learning to prepare a steak was an exhilarating experience. I was proud of myself forgetting on to the ropes and mastering this new skill, and I enjoyed the satisfaction of creating adelicious meal that I could share with others.</em></p>

<p><strong>1. Percentage of population in living cities</strong></p>
<p>This line graph illustrates the proportion of urban citizens in Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia between 1970 and 2020, with the expected population in 2030 and 2040.</p>
<p>Overall, it can be easily seen from the graph that all four countries has a dramatic rise in population, starting at the lowest point in 1970 and being projected to reach the peak in 2040.</p>
<p>Malaysia starts at 30%, about twice as much as Indonesia. After that, both showed an obvious increase, with the former rising to approximately 76% in 2020, and the latter rising to approximately 50%. Both sides are expected to continue rising thereafter, with Malaysia slowly rising to about 83%, while Indonesia is expected to see a 12% gain.</p>
<p>The starting point of Philippines is about 31%, which is about 13% higher than Thailand. Over the next decade, the Philippines remained relatively stable. Between 1980 and 1990, the Philippines rose to about 48%, but fell to about 42% over the next 20 years. During this period, Thailand showed a gradual increase from 18% to approximately 30%. After 2010, both countries are expected to show an upward trend, rising to 55% and 49% respectively.</p>

<p><strong>1. The most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?</strong></p>
<p>The proposition that the most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives is a significant one, meriting thoughtful consideration. This essay will argue that, while the improvement of human lives is a crucial goal of science, it should not be viewed as its sole purpose.</p>
<p>Firstly, the advancement of human welfare through scientific discovery has undeniably been monumental. Medical science, for instance, has dramatically enhanced the quality and longevity of life. The development of vaccines, antibiotics, and advanced surgical techniques has transformed healthcare, drastically reducing mortality rates and improving the management of chronic diseases. Moreover, technological innovations, a product of scientific research, have reshaped daily life, offering unparalleled convenience and efficiency. The advent of the internet, smartphones, and smart home technology are prime examples of how science has made everyday tasks more accessible and interconnected.</p>
<p>However, the pursuit of science for the sheer expansion of knowledge should also be recognized as an essential aim. Many scientific endeavors, such as space exploration or the study of fundamental physics, may not have immediate practical applications but are crucial for our understanding of the universe. The pursuit of such knowledge can lead to unforeseen benefits. For example, the exploration of space has led to the development of satellite communication, GPS technology, and numerous other applications that have had a considerable impact on daily life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it's important to consider the ethical and societal implications of focusing solely on science that improves human life. Such a focus might lead to the neglect of crucial environmental or ecological research, which may not have direct benefits for humans in the short term but are essential for the sustainability of life on Earth. Additionally, this approach might bias funding and attention towards projects with immediate commercial benefits, potentially at the expense of basic science research.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while improving human lives is a vital goal of scientific endeavor, it should not be the only aim. The pursuit of knowledge for its own sake and the exploration of questions beyond immediate human concerns are equally important. This broader perspective ensures a balanced approach to science, where the pursuit of understanding and the betterment of humanity go hand in hand.</p>
<p><strong>2.Some university students want to learn about other subjects in addition to their main subjects. Others believe it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for a qualification.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. In many countries, people are now living longer than ever before. Some people say an ageing population creates problems for governments. Other people think there are benefits if society has more elderly people. To what extent do the advantages of having an ageing population outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></p>
<p>In the contemporary era, the phenomenon of an aging population has become increasingly prominent across the globe, thanks to advancements in medical technology and improvements in living standards. While some argue that this trend poses significant challenges to societies and governments, I contend that the benefits of an aging population far outweigh its disadvantages, heralding a more sustainable and wisdom-oriented future.</p>
<p>On the one hand, critics of demographic aging often highlight the economic and social strains it imposes. Primarily, the increasing number of elderly individuals elevates the demand for pensions and healthcare services, potentially straining public finances and placing a heavier burden on the younger working-age population. Furthermore, a shrinking workforce could lead to decreased productivity and economic stagnation. These concerns, while valid, overlook the evolving nature of modern economies and the adaptability of social systems.</p>
<p>Conversely, the advantages of an aging population are manifold and, in my opinion, eclipse the aforementioned challenges. Firstly, elderly individuals contribute significantly to society through the transfer of knowledge and skills, mentoring younger generations and fostering a culture of wisdom and experience. Their active participation in volunteer work and the informal economy also adds substantial value, often unaccounted for in traditional economic metrics.</p>
<p>Moreover, the aging demographic drives innovation and growth in critical sectors. The healthcare and eldercare industries, for example, are prompted to advance in terms of services and technologies, ranging from personalized medicine to smart home systems, thereby creating new employment opportunities and stimulating economic vitality. This not only enhances the quality of life for the elderly but also benefits society as a whole by accelerating technological and medical advancements.</p>
<p>Additionally, an aging society encourages a shift towards more sustainable living practices. As populations age, there tends to be a decrease in resource-intensive consumption patterns, aligning more closely with environmental sustainability goals. This demographic shift can thus act as a catalyst for societies to adopt greener lifestyles and policies, contributing to the global effort against climate change.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the aging population presents certain challenges, these are not insurmountable. With strategic planning and policy adjustments, societies can harness the potential benefits of this demographic trend. The wealth of experience and knowledge that older individuals offer, combined with the stimulus they provide for innovation and sustainability, underscores the positive aspects of an aging society. Therefore, it is clear that the advantages of having an aging population significantly outweigh the disadvantages, marking a pivotal step towards a more sustainable and enlightened future.</p>
<p><strong>4. In many countries around the world, rural people are moving to cities, so the population in the countryside is decreasing. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?</strong></p>
<p>In numerous nations worldwide, the trend of rural populations migrating to urban areas is prominent, leading to a dwindling number of inhabitants in the countryside. This shift, in my opinion, embodies a double-edged sword, reflecting the complex dynamics of societal evolution.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the allure of cities is undeniable. Urban centers, with their advanced infrastructure and abundant employment prospects, magnetize individuals seeking improved livelihoods. The superior quality of urban life, coupled with the automation of agricultural practices reducing rural labor demand, underscores the rationality behind this migration. Such developments signify progress, offering individuals the freedom to pursue a broader spectrum of opportunities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this influx into urban areas introduces several challenges. Skyrocketing housing prices, escalating traffic congestion, rising unemployment rates, and deteriorating living conditions due to pollution are immediate repercussions. Moreover, the urban expansion necessitates converting more land into cityscapes, potentially straining resources. The diminished rural workforce and reduced agricultural lands could hinder food production, highlighting a critical balance between consumption and production that must be maintained.</p>
<p>Yet, the phenomenon of urbanization is not a one-way street. The concept of reverse urbanization, where individuals return to rural areas seeking respite from urban chaos, illustrates a natural recalibration process. This cycle suggests that concerns regarding urban overpopulation and rural depopulation may eventually equilibrate.</p>
<p>Hence, viewing rural-to-urban migration through a binary lens of positive or negative oversimplifies its implications. This movement is an intrinsic aspect of societal advancement, where the intertwined challenges and benefits will ultimately pave the way for a balanced development.</p>
